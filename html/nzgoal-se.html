      Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>1.</strong> Government agencies invest significantly
      in software development and often own the copyright in the
      software that they develop or that is developed for them.
      Public sharing and the licensing of this government-owned
      software under free and open source software licence terms
      has the potential to:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>save agencies time and money, resulting in a more
      efficient use of scarce resources;
      </li>
      <li>encourage open innovation on the part of both the public
      and private sectors;
      </li>
      <li>contribute to economic growth, primarily through the
      private sector being able to leverage and support government
      investment in the software it openly releases for re-use;
      </li>
      <li>contribute to the formation of trusted communities of
      users whose public and private sector members have common or
      similar goals or interests;
      </li>
      <li>result in continuous and ongoing maintenance of the
      released software code through these communities of users in
      a way that may not be achievable by a single agency alone;
      </li>
      <li>enable agencies to better align their operational and
      strategic activities with relevant aspects of the Government
      ICT Strategy 2015; and
      </li>
      <li>in some cases, foster transparency — for those who can
      read software code — as to the methods or algorithms used for
      the creation or delivery of public data and services, thereby
      enabling critical analysis and potentially the provision of
      improvements back to the releasing agency.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>2.</strong> This NZGOAL Software Extension
      (<strong>NZGOAL-SE</strong>) provides agencies with a means
      of realising this potential. It:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>explains the legal and policy context that is relevant to
      agencies' open source licensing of software;
      </li>
      <li>sets out a series of policy principles to guide agencies
      in their open sharing of software code;
      </li>
      <li>advocates the use of particular open source software
      licences for this purpose; and
      </li>
      <li>sets out a review and release process to guide agencies
      through the review of the software they propose to release
      for re-use, the purpose of which is to help agencies make
      decisions that are legally robust and practically useful.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="free-and-open-source-software-and-licences">
      Free and open source software and licences
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>3.</strong> For the purposes of NZGOAL-SE, free and
      open source software (<strong>FOSS</strong>) is software
      source code that is released on licence terms that grant
      others the freedom to use, copy, modify and distribute the
      software, for either non-commercial or commercial purposes,
      as long as they comply with the applicable licensing
      conditions. It is important to note the following:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>the licensing conditions that users of the software need
      to comply with depend on the form of FOSS licence applied to
      the software;
      </li>
      <li>"free" in FOSS refers to the granting of a set of
      "freedoms" or permissions usually only available to the
      copyright owner and arising from the bundle of property
      rights the owner has in its copyright work; and
      </li>
      <li>there are several common phrases in use that refer to the
      same style of licensing, such as "free software", "free and
      open source software", "open source", "FOSS", "OSS" and
      "FLOSS". Depending on the context, NZGOAL-SE uses a
      combination of "free and open source software", "FOSS" and
      "open source", all with the same meaning referred to above.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>4.</strong> There are two main forms of FOSS licence:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>more permissive licences</strong> that confer broad
        freedoms and minimal obligations on those who wish to use,
        adapt and distribute the software (e.g., the MIT licence,
        the BSD licence and the Apache 2.0 licence); and
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>sharealike licences</strong> (also known as
        copyleft licences) that confer similar freedoms and require
        those who adapt the licensed software to license their
        adaptations with the same licence if they distribute them
        (e.g., the GNU General Public License, or GPL for short).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="approach-and-scope">
      Approach and scope
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>5.</strong> NZGOAL-SE is an extension of, and is
      modelled in part on the approach to, the open licensing of
      government copyright works set out in the New Zealand
      Government Open Access and Licensing framework
      (<strong>NZGOAL</strong>). NZGOAL-SE is a self-contained
      extension or framework, rather than being part of the
      original NZGOAL framework, because certain considerations are
      different to those relating to open information and data.
      Incorporating both frameworks under a single roof would
      unduly complicate matters for agencies and others interested
      in the frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>6.</strong> NZGOAL-SE is not concerned with the
      proprietary versus open source debate or with the
      considerations that agencies may wish to take into account
      when using existing open source for their own internal
      purposes<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
      "fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Its sole focus is on the public
      release and open source licensing by agencies of software
      they own or are authorised to release and license.
    </p>
    <h3 id="additional-guidance-notes">
      Additional guidance notes
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>7.</strong> Additional guidance notes may be released
      over time which:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>explore, in greater detail, some of the issues addressed
      or raised in NZGOAL-SE; or
      </li>
      <li>address operational or technical issues which arise in
      practice.

      Copyright law

    <p>
      <strong>8.</strong> Key aspects of copyright law relevant to
      open licensing generally are set out in the NZGOAL Copyright
      Guide.<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name=
      "fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Additional aspects relating
      specifically to software include the following:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>copyright exists in original</strong>
        <strong>software</strong>: software is a form of "literary
        work" and original literary works are a category of works
        in which copyright exists (section 14(1) of the Copyright
        Act 1994 and the section 2(1) definition of "literary
        work");
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>infringement</strong>: as such, unless entitled to
        do so by a copyright licence or statutory provision, a
        person infringes copyright in software that that person
        does not own when he or she does any of a number of
        "restricted acts", the most common of which is copying the
        work or a substantial part of it or adapting the work;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>adaptations</strong>: an "adaptation", in relation
        to a literary work that is a computer program (i.e.,
        software), includes "a version of the program in which it
        is converted into or out of a computer language or code or
        into a different computer language or code, otherwise than
        incidentally in the course of running the program" (section
        2(1));
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>first owner of copyright</strong>:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>
            <strong>employee-employer relationship</strong>: when
            employees create software for their employer in the
            course of employment, the employer is the first owner
            of copyright in the software unless the employment
            contract states otherwise. This is the case where the
            employer is the Crown (section 26) and where the
            employer is another person, agency or entity (section
            21(2));
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>service provider-customer
            relationship</strong>: when a service provider creates
            software for a customer under a contract for services,
            the customer is the first owner of copyright in the
            software unless the contract for services states
            otherwise. Again, this is the case where the customer
            is the Crown (section 26) and where the customer is
            another person, agency or entity (section 21(3)).

      Guidelines for Treatment of Intellectual Property Rights in
      ICT Contracts
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>9.</strong> These Guidelines<a href="#fn3" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref3" name="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> are
      relevant where an agency procures the development of software
      from a service provider. They state that only in limited
      circumstances should the government own and exploit new
      intellectual property rights (<strong>IPR</strong>) created
      under an ICT contract. The default position is that the
      supplier should own the new IPR, with licences being granted
      to the customer agency and other State Services agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.</strong> This position could create an obstacle
      to an agency licensing developed software on open source
      terms because the agency can only do so if it has the
      requisite rights to do so. If it doesn't own the copyright,
      it doesn't have the requisite rights unless expressly
      authorised by the copyright owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.</strong> The Guidelines recognise, however, that
      there may be situations where an agency needs to own the IPR.
      One of those situations is where the agency "intends to allow
      free use of the IPR on open source terms". Agencies would,
      therefore, be acting consistently with these Guidelines if
      they were to require the development contract to confer
      ownership of copyright in the software on the agency, on the
      basis that they wish to license the software on open source
      terms.<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name=

    <h2 id="government-rules-of-sourcing">
      Government Rules of Sourcing
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>12.</strong> Who is to own the copyright in new
      software is a significant issue that needs to be considered
      at the time of procuring the software development services, a
      point that is made clear in Rule 61(1) (Intellectual
      Property) of the Government Rules of Sourcing.<a href="#fn5"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name=

      "If an agency's procurement of goods, services or works
      involves the supplier creating new Intellectual Property, the
      agency <strong>should</strong> set out, in its Notice of
      Procurement, its intentions regarding ownership, licensing,
      and future commercialisation of that Intellectual Property."

      <strong>14.</strong> If government agencies have the required

    <p>
      <strong>16.</strong> Paragraph 14 makes it clear that, for
      the Open Access and Licensing Principle to apply, an agency
      must have the required copyright-related rights to license
      the software.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>17.</strong> Agencies should only license software
      for re-use by others under a FOSS licence where:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>they own or can obtain an assignment of all copyright in
      the software and have not exclusively licensed it to a third
      party; or

      <li>to the extent they do not own the copyright, they have or
      can obtain permission from the copyright owner(s) to do so
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      (the <strong>Rights Clearance Principle</strong>). It can be
      important, in this context, to check whether developers have
      reused tracts of code from elsewhere and, if they have, to
      assess the licences that apply to those tracts to ensure the
      agency has all the rights it needs.

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>civil wrongs</strong>: open source licensing of the

        or other actionable wrong;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>commercial interests</strong>: open source
        licensing of the software would be contrary to an agency's
        own or the Government's legitimate commercial interests
        (note, however, that most government agencies are not in
        the business of commercialising developed software);
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>security or privacy risk</strong>: release of the
        software on open source terms would create an unacceptable
        security risk (whether to an agency, organisation or
        individuals) or an unacceptable privacy-related risk.
      </li>

    </p>
    <h2 id="adaptations">
      Adaptations
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>19.</strong> In the course of its activities, an
      agency may incorporate or adapt pre-existing software source
      code that is licensed under one or more FOSS licences.
      Alternatively, an agency may produce new software source code
      that interacts with a pre-existing FOSS-licensed application.
      Take a plug-in or extension to an existing application as an
      example. Depending on the context, a plug-in or extension may
      be an adaptation of pre-existing source code (e.g., where it
      has forked an old plug-in or extension) or it may be new
      source code designed to interact with a pre-existing
      application but without taking any pre-existing source code.
      If an agency proposes to release its source code in these
      kinds of situations, the agency should:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>respect the terms and conditions of the existing licences
      (such as attribution requirements); and
      </li>
      <li>where possible, use the same free and open source licence
      or licences applying to the pre-existing software source
      code, even in cases where - strictly speaking - it is not
      required to do so
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      (the <strong>Respect Existing Licences Principle</strong>).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>20.</strong> It is important to note that using more
      permissively-licensed source code (e.g., MIT-licensed source
      code) and sharealike/copyleft-licensed source code (e.g.,
      GPL-licensed source code) together in a broader project may
      require you to release your new source code under the same
      sharealike/copyleft licence or a compatible licence (in most
      cases the licence will be version 2 or 3 of the GPL)<a href=
      "#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref9" name=
      "fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> rather than under the more
      permissive licence. Whether this is the case depends on the
      circumstances. Legal advice should be sought if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>21.</strong> Difficult legal questions can arise as
      to whether a given piece of developed software, that in some
      way leverages or interacts with other software, is in fact an
      adaptation or derivative of that software. If:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>an agency's developed software does leverage or interact
      with other software; and
      </li>
      <li>that other software, or part of it, is software owned by
      a third party that has been released under a sharealike open
      source software licence like the GPL,
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      the agency should be cautious about concluding that its
      developed software is <em>not</em> an adaptation or
      derivative of the other software. The need for caution arises
      because if the agency concludes mistakenly that the developed
      software is not an adaptation, release of the developed
      software under an incorrect licence could result in the
      agency breaching third party rights and expose it to the risk
      of complaint or legal action. End users would also be at risk
      of breaching third party rights and be exposed to the risk of
      complaint or legal action. If an agency is in any doubt on
      this issue, it should seek specialist advice (which could be
      both technical and legal) before releasing the software for
      re-use.

      <em>Contribution guidance and files</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>28.</strong> Part of the value of releasing free and
      open source software in accordance with the Open Access and
      Licensing Principle is that external contributors can re-use
      and contribute back improvements to agency-released software
      source code. To accept contributions from external
      contributors in a manner that enables contributions to be
      licensed properly and shared with others, agencies should
      consider providing explicit contribution guidance to users
      that:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>explains any technical aspects of making the
      contributions;
      </li>
      <li>sets expectations for users as to how the agency will
      review and accept contributions of source code;
      </li>
      <li>sets out any code of conduct, moderation policy or terms
      of use that apply when external contributors engage publicly
      in discussions about the agency-released software source
      code;
      </li>
      <li>indicates whether external contributors need to
      physically sign and return a contributor licence
      agreement<a href="#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13"
      name="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> or other document before the
      agency will accept contributions from them, or specifies that
      the act of contributing source code means the contributing
      user is agreeing to license his or her contributions to the
      agency and others under a specified FOSS licence; and
      </li>
      <li>ensures that users know that they must own the copyright
      in their contributions or be permitted to license them to the
      agency and others under the licence that the agency specifies
      (this is important as it seeks to mitigate the risk of the
      agency accepting and publishing external contributions that,
      for copyright reasons, should not be accepted and published).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>29.</strong> In the open source software context, a
      common means of providing this contribution guidance to users
      is by including a 'contributing' file in documentation that
      accompanies the source code. It is important that this file
      (or other document if an alternative approach is used) is
      brought to the attention of users before or at the time they
      submit contributions. Some source code repositories bring the
      existence of a 'contributing' file to the attention of users
      at the time of submission but if an agency is not using such
      a repository it should take care to ensure the terms of
      contribution are brought to users' attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>30.</strong> Whilst this is a decision for agencies,
      NZGOAL-SE suggests that it will usually be unnecessary,
      administratively burdensome and potentially counterproductive
      to require contributing users to physically sign and return a
      formal contributor licence agreement or other document. In
      most cases agencies will be able to secure the rights they
      need, with sufficient confidence, by including the
      'contributing' file mentioned above in documentation
      accompanying the source code and ensuring that this file is
      brought to users' attention before or at the time of
      submitting their contributions. Agencies should seek advice
      from their legal teams if required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Comment on assignment versus licensing</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>31.</strong> Agencies may wish to note that there are
      two ways in which an agency could obtain the rights it needs
      from contributors. An agency could require contributing users
      to assign (i.e., transfer) any copyright in their
      contributions to the agency or it could require contributors
      to license their contributions to the agency and others under
      a specified FOSS licence. The advantage of seeking
      assignments of copyright is that this enables the party
      maintaining the source code to own it all. That makes it
      easier to take action against a user who does not comply with
      the applicable FOSS licence terms. The significant
      disadvantage of seeking assignments of copyright is that it
      can inhibit contributions (as developers may wish to retain
      their copyright). In a government context, it could also be
      seen as 'over-reaching'. An assignment also needs to be "in
      writing signed by or on behalf of the assignor" (section 114
      of the Copyright Act 1994). It will be evident from the
      approach suggested above that NZGOAL-SE does <em>not</em>
      recommend that agencies seek to obtain assignments of
      copyright in users' contributions. Rather, the suggested
      approach allows contributors to retain their own copyright
      and only requires them to license their contributions under a
      specified FOSS licence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <em>Suggested licensing text for 'contributing' file</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>32.</strong> NZGOAL-SE suggests that agencies include
      the following kind of licensing text in their 'contributing'
      file or other documentation that they bring to the attention
      of users before or at the time of source code submission (the
      content in square brackets needs to be completed):
    </p>
    <pre><code>Copyright and licensing

The source code for this [name of project or software] is licensed under the [insert name of applicable free and open source software licence]. By contributing source code to this [name of project or software], you are agreeing to license your contributions under and on the terms of the [insert name of same licence]. Please note that your licence is irrevocable and royalty-free. You or your licensors retain any copyright in your contributions while allowing others to re-use the source code in any way they like as long as they meet the requirements of the licence.</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>33.</strong> Agencies may also wish to ensure that
      the 'contributing' file, or other document that is brought to
      the attention of users, contains the matters referred to in
      paragraph 28(a)-(e) above.<a href="#fn14" class="footnoteRef"

      <strong>34.</strong> When procuring or commissioning the

      whether they may wish to release the software to the public
      for re-use under an open source software licence. If the

      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>41.</strong> It is recommended that government
      agencies follow the review and release process set out below
      before releasing software source code for re-use under a FOSS
      licence, with assistance where required from their technical
      and legal teams. The process consists of five main stages:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>copyright-related rights evaluation;
      </li>
      <li>evaluation of exceptions;
      </li>
      <li>select a FOSS licence;
      </li>
      <li>application of the chosen licence; and
      </li>
      <li>release of the software.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>42.</strong> Each stage contains one or more issues
      that may need to be worked through. The stages and the issues
      within them reflect a mixture of the NZGOAL-SE Policy
      Principles, legal requirements and practical considerations.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>43.</strong> It can be important to work through
      these steps to ensure that the agency:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>has all relevant rights in or to the software source code
      it proposes to publicly release;
      </li>
      <li>uses the appropriate open source licence; and
      </li>
      <li>does not expose either itself or those who may re-use the
      released software to liability or related risk.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>44.</strong> A decision tree diagram for the review
      and release process is set out at paragraph 82 below.

      Stage 1: Copyright-related rights evaluation
    </h2>
    <h3 id="what-the-stage-involves">
      What the stage involves
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>45.</strong> The first stage involves:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>clearly identifying the boundaries of the software that
      the agency proposes to release (e.g., the software may
      comprise a range of files, all of which would need to be
      released together);
      </li>
      <li>determining whether that software constitutes or contains
      one or more copyright works; and, if so
      </li>
      <li>evaluating whether the agency has sufficient rights to
      license the software under open source terms.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>46.</strong> In the vast majority of cases, software
      that an agency wishes to license will constitute or contain
      one or more copyright works. In the unlikely event that a
      given piece of software does not constitute or contain one or
      more copyright works, an agency could, if no exception in
      Stage 2 applies, release it into the public domain using an
      NZGOAL-style "no known rights" statement. See NZGOAL for that
      statement. It is not discussed further in NZGOAL-SE.
    </p>
    <h3 id="issues-where-agency-does-not-own-all-copyright">
      Issues where agency does not own all copyright
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>47.</strong> When an agency is in the situation of
      not owning all copyright in the software it would like to
      release and license for re-use and needs permission from the
      copyright owner(s), it is important to appreciate that the
      software may:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>be all new source code (i.e., be a completely new
      copyright work);<a href="#fn15" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref15" name="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> or
      </li>
      <li>build on pre-existing source code (i.e., be an adaptation
      / derivative of pre-existing source code).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>48.</strong> The analysis for these two scenarios is
      different:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>All new source code</strong>: In the case of all
        new source code that the agency doesn't own but wishes to
        license, the agency would need to either:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>already be entitled, under a FOSS licence that the
          owner has recently applied to the software, to
          sub-license the software; or
          </li>
          <li>obtain irrevocable written permission from the
          copyright owner to sub-license the software on the
          relevant open source terms. <strong>Notes on
          sub-licensing</strong>: As to the first option, it is
          important to note three points. First, if the software
          has already been licensed under a FOSS licence, there may
          be no need for the agency to sub-license it because
          anyone who gets the software has the rights granted by
          the licence that the owner has applied. Second, some
          licences prohibit sub-licensing. For example, you cannot
          sub-license GPL-licensed software. Third, if there is a
          right to sub-license, that right would need to be broad
          enough to allow sub-licensing under the particular FOSS
          licence that the agency wishes to apply to the software.

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adaptation / derivative of pre-existing
        code</strong>: In the case of an adaptation / derivative of
        pre-existing source code, the agency would need to:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>be able to identify who owns the pre-existing source
          code (noting that there could be more than 1
          owner/contributor) and who has made and owns the new
          copyright in the adaptation / derivative work; and
          </li>
          <li>to the extent that the agency does not own the
          copyright in the adaptation / derivative work, have
          permission from the other copyright owner(s) for their
          parts of the overall new work to be licensed under the
          FOSS licence the agency wishes to use. To understand
          this, one needs to appreciate that an adaptation /
          derivative work consists of property (copyright) owned by
          the original licensor(s) (let's call them A) plus new and
          separate property (copyright) over the new original parts
          of the adaptation / derivative work that are created by
          B. The adaptation / derivative work is a distinct
          copyright work in its own right but B doesn't obtain
          property rights that are greater than B's own
          contribution. As a United States court has put it, "[t]he
          aspects of a derivative work added by the derivative
          author are that author's property, but the element drawn
          from the pre-existing work remains on grant from the
          owner of the pre-existing work".<a href="#fn16" class=
          "footnoteRef" id="fnref16" name=

          pre-existing owners, the licences (if any) under which
          they may have released their code and the licence the
          agency wishes to apply to the adaptation / derivative
          work, this can get complex very quickly. In cases of any
          complexity, agencies may need to seek expert legal
          advice.

      Common scenarios where an agency will not be able to license
      software for re-use
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>49.</strong> There are certain scenarios in which,
      from a copyright perspective, an agency will not be able to
      license software either under <em>any</em> FOSS licence or
      under a <em>particular</em> FOSS licence. Three common
      scenarios are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>third party owner</strong>: copyright in the
        software is owned by a third party and the agency is not
        permitted to license the software for re-use under a FOSS
        licence. In this scenario the agency cannot license the
        software under any FOSS licence;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>adaptations of proprietary software</strong>: the
        software is an adaptation or derivative of proprietary
        software and the agency does not have the proprietary
        software owner's written and irrevocable authorisation to
        license the adaptation or derivative under a FOSS licence
        (whilst the agency might own the copyright in its new
        contributions, it still needs authorisation from the owner
        of the base software that it adapted). In this scenario the
        agency cannot license the software under any FOSS licence;
        and
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>adaptations of GPL or similarly FOSS-licensed
        software</strong>: the agency wishes to license the
        software under the MIT licence but the software is an
        adaptation or derivative of open source software that is
        licensed under a sharealike FOSS licence, such as the GPL,
        that requires distributed or conveyed adaptations or
        derivative works to be licensed under the same licence. In
        this scenario the agency cannot license its adaptation
        under the MIT licence.
      </li>

    <h2 id="stage-2-evaluation-of-exceptions">
      Stage 2: Evaluation of exceptions
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>50.</strong> If an agency has completed Stage 1 and
      concluded that it does have sufficient rights to license the
      software under a FOSS licence, then the NZGOAL-SE Policy
      Principles recommend that the software be licensed under open
      source terms unless an exception set out in paragraph 18
      applies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>51.</strong> For each proposed release, the
      exceptions need to be considered in the light of all the
      surrounding circumstances relevant to the specific software
      and its release.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>52.</strong> In many instances, the exercise will be
      quick as none of the restrictions will apply. In that event,
      the agency can proceed to Stage 3 (Select a FOSS Licence)
      below. This is because the Open Access and Licensing
      Principle will not have been displaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>53.</strong> If one or more of the exceptions
      applies, the Open Access and Licensing Principle will be
      displaced and not apply. One of two consequences will follow:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>No FOSS licensing</strong>: FOSS licensing of the
        source code may not be possible unless the reason for the
        exception(s) can be removed in accordance with paragraph
        53(b). If FOSS licensing is not possible, the analysis ends
        and there is no need to consider the subsequent stages
        below.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>FOSS licensing after amending or anonymising the
        source code</strong>: If the source code can be amended or
        altered to remove the reason(s) for the exception(s)
        applying, the Open Access and Licensing Principle is
        resurrected and one progresses to Stage 3.

    <h3 id="introduction-4">
      Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>54.</strong> Once an agency has determined that it
      has:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>the copyright-related rights it needs to license the
      software (in accordance with the Rights Clearance Principle);

      negate the Open Access and Licensing Principle applies,
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      the agency can work through Stage 3 to select the appropriate
      FOSS licence before applying the selected licence in
      accordance with Stage 4.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>55.</strong> In most cases, an agency's selection of
      a FOSS licence is likely to turn on the answers to one or
      more of the following questions:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>whether the source code builds upon and/or interacts with
      existing FOSS-licensed source code;
      </li>
      <li>if the source code does not build upon and/or interact
      with existing FOSS-licensed source code, whether a person who
      adapts the code and distributes it to others should be
      required to license the adaptations for re-use by others;
      </li>
      <li>whether there are known reasons or use cases for
      releasing the source code under a FOSS licence other than the
      recommended GPL or MIT licences.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>56.</strong> NZGOAL-SE does recommend a default set
      of licences (GPL and MIT) but a "yes" answer to the first
      question may require (legally or ethically) the selection of
      a different FOSS licence and a "yes" answer to the third
      question might suggest that a more targeted FOSS licence is
      preferable. Each of the three questions is now discussed in
      turn.

    "source-code-builds-upon-andor-interacts-with-existing-third-party-foss-licensed-source-code---respect-existing-licences">
      Source code builds upon and/or interacts with existing third
      party FOSS-licensed source code - respect existing licence(s)
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>57.</strong> If the source code builds upon and/or
      interacts with existing third party FOSS-licensed source
      code, the Respect Existing Licences Principle applies. In
      this scenario, an agency should — where possible — select the
      same licence(s) for its new software code as the licences
      applying to the pre-existing source code (the upstream
      licences), or licences that are compatible with the upstream
      licence(s). For consistency reasons, using the same
      licence(s) is usually preferable to using compatible
      licence(s).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>58.</strong> To give an example, if an agency
      developed a software library that interacts with a
      pre-existing open source application licensed under the
      Berkley Software Distribution (BSD) licence<a href="#fn17"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref17" name=
      "fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a>, it would be consistent with the
      Respect Existing Licences Principle for the agency to license
      its new source code under the BSD as well. Effectively, the
      BSD licence would become the selected FOSS licence as an
      outcome of the Stage 3 analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>59.</strong> Note, however, that the words "where
      possible" are used above because it will not always be
      possible to apply the same licences as the upstream licences.
      This can be the case where different parts of the
      pre-existing software the agency has used are licensed under
      different FOSS licences. For example, some of the
      pre-existing code might be licensed under the MIT licence
      (which is not a sharealike / copyleft licence) and other
      parts of the code might be licensed under the GPL (which is a
      sharealike / copyleft licence).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>60.</strong> Where an agency uses these differently
      licensed parts of software in a broader project (e.g., the
      agency might adapt the pre-existing software) the agency may
      be required, by the sharealike licence, to release its new
      code under the sharealike licence when the agency distributes
      its new code. In other words, a sharealike licence like the
      GPL may trump the non-sharealike licence (in this example,
      the MIT licence). Generally speaking, if an agency is using
      multiple pieces of software in a project and those pieces are
      licensed under different FOSS licences (non-sharealike and
      sharealike), new code should be released under the sharealike
      licence and not the non-sharealike licence. See the
      Adaptations Principle in paragraphs 19-21 for further
      explanation and, if in doubt, seek legal advice before
      selecting and applying a FOSS licence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>61.</strong> To give an example, if an agency
      develops and distributes a plugin for a content management
      system that, legally speaking, is an adaptation of
      MIT-licensed code and GPL-licensed code that the agency has
      mixed together and used, the agency may need to license the
      plugin under the GPL. Whether there is an "adaptation" can be
      a difficult legal question in some cases but, if there is an
      adaptation, the GPL will trump.
    </p>
    <h3 id="entirely-new-source-code---default-foss-licences">
      Entirely new source code - default FOSS licences
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>62.</strong> As noted above, NZGOAL-SE recommends a
      default set of licences - two licences - for cases in which
      an agency wishes to release entirely new source code for
      re-use; in other words, for cases in which the source code to
      be released does not build upon and/or interact with existing
      FOSS-licensed source code.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>63.</strong> The default licences, in no particular
      order, are the GPL licence and the MIT licence. These default
      licences and the reasons for selecting them as the NZGOAL-SE
      defaults are described in the NZGOAL Policy Principles (Open
      access and public release of agency software using free and
      open source licences).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>64.</strong> NZGOAL-SE suggests that an agency's
      choice between these two default licences should turn on the
      answer to this simple question: would you like everyone to be
      able to re-use other people's distributed adaptations of the
      source code in the future?<a href="#fn18" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref18" name="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a>
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>65.</strong> If the answer to this question is yes —
      that is, a person who adapts the code and distributes it to
      others should be required to license the adaptations for
      re-use by others — then the agency should select the GPL
      (version 3).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>66.</strong> If the answer to this question is no — a
      person who adapts the code and distributes it to others does
      not need to license the adaptations for re-use by others —
      then the agency should select the MIT licence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>67.</strong> Answering the question yes or no is a
      judgement call for the agency.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>68.</strong> In either case, the agency should
      proceed to Stage 4 (Application of chosen licence) unless
      there are known reasons or use cases for releasing the source
      code under a FOSS licence other than the recommended GPL or
      MIT licences (as discussed immediately below).
    </p>
    <h3 id=
    "known-reasons-or-use-cases-for-releasing-source-code-under-an-alternative-foss-licence">
      Known reasons or use cases for releasing source code under an
      alternative FOSS licence
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>69.</strong> In some cases an agency may wish to
      release entirely new source code and there may be specific
      known reasons or use cases for not opting for the GPL or MIT
      licences. Two examples of this are as follows:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>Libraries</strong>: the source code to be released
        is a library of code and the agency knows that there are
        proprietary software suppliers who wish to use the agency's
        particular library within, or to link the library to, their
        own proprietary source code without having to release (or
        it being argued that they have to release) their
        proprietary code if they distribute their software. The GNU
        Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL) will allow this kind
        of use without exposing the downstream user to risk. The
        LGPL requires software licensed under it to be modifiable
        by end users through source code availability and does not
        require proprietary code that is linked to the
        LGPL-licensed library to be made available under the GPL.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Server side use of licensed software</strong>: the
        sharealike obligation in the GPL (i.e., the obligation to
        license one's adaptations under the GPL) is triggered upon
        distribution of an adaptation. Where software is installed
        on a server to provide a service to end users (e.g., in an
        application service provider or cloud services context),
        the sharealike obligation is not triggered. To some people
        this seemed like a loophole. The GNU Affero General Public
        Licence (AGPL) was designed to close that loophole. It is
        based on the GPL and sates that if source code is adapted
        then the "public use of a modified version, on a publicly
        accessible server, gives the public access to the source
        code of the modified version". <a href="#fn19" class=
        "footnoteRef" id="fnref19" name="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a>
        There may be cases in which an agency is FOSS-licensing
        software that is used on servers where the agency would
        like to achieve this result or where communities of
        interest ask the agency to achieve this result. If so, the
        agency may wish to select the GNU Affero General Public
        Licence (AGPL) instead of the GPL.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>70.</strong> The selection of licences for unusual
      use cases like these can be difficult and in some cases using
      one of the NZGOAL-SE default licences (the GPL or MIT
      licence) may suffice. If in doubt, seek technical or legal
      advice in the context of your particular use case.
    </p>
    <h3 id="licensing-of-accompanying-documentation">
      Licensing of accompanying documentation
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>71.</strong> Explanatory documentation files included
      alongside open source software code are usually separate
      copyright works. These works are often thought to be licenced
      under the FOSS licence that has been applied to the source
      code. However, most FOSS licences used for source code are
      not designed for documentation and often don't naturally or
      comfortably apply. A more appropriate approach is to apply a
      Creative Commons licence to documentation in accordance with
      NZGOAL.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>72.</strong> Two situations need to be considered:
      the first is where the agency has created completely new
      documentation, the second where the agency has adapted
      pre-existing documentation.
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>New documentation</strong>: In the case of new
        documentation that the agency owns (i.e., it owns the
        copyright), the Creative Commons licensing is
        straight-forward. In this situation, NZGOAL-SE recommends
        that the Creative Commons licence choice reflect the nature
        of the selected FOSS licence. This means that an agency
        releasing new documentation alongside source code released
        under:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>a <em>more permissive licence</em> such as the MIT
          licence, should license the documentation under a
          <strong>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International
          licence</strong>; and
          </li>
          <li>a <em>sharealike/copyleft licence</em> such as the
          GPL, should license the documentation under a
          <strong>Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike 4.0
          International licence</strong>.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Adapted documentation</strong>: If an agency is
        adapting pre-existing documentation that accompanied
        pre-existing FOSS-licensed software, it may be necessary to
        respect the licence (if any) that had been applied to the
        pre-existing documentation. For example, if the
        pre-existing documentation had been licensed under a
        Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike (CC-BY-SA) 4.0
        International licence then, when the agency publishes its
        adaptation, it would need to license the adaptation under a
        CC-BY-SA licence. Sometimes an agency may find that
        existing documentation is licensed under an unfamiliar or
        unnecessarily complex licence. The agency may still wish to
        release its own documentation relating to, for example, its
        adapted part of the software, but the agency would prefer
        to use a Creative Commons licence for it. In this situation
        the agency may be able to create a new and separate
        document that contains the additional information the
        agency wishes to provide. That in all likelihood would be a
        new and standalone copyright work rather than an adaptation
        of an existing work. In that case, and assuming the agency
        owns the copyright in the new document, it could select a
        Creative Commons licence for the document.

    <h3 id="the-copyright-notice">
      The copyright notice
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>75.</strong> When applying a licence, it is common
      practice to add the year the software was completed and the
      name of the copyright owner(s), in the following format:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>    Copyright (c) &lt;year&gt; &lt;copyright holders&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>76.</strong> If the licensing agency is a department
      of the Crown, it should also replace "Copyright" with "Crown
      copyright". For example, if the licensing agency were a
      department, its licensing statement would look something like
      this:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>    Crown copyright (c) 2015, Land Information New Zealand on behalf of the New Zealand Government.</code></pre>
    <p>
      <strong>77.</strong> If the licensing agency is not part of
      the Crown (e.g., it might be a Crown entity), it would use
      the term "Copyright" rather than "Crown copyright" and it
      would state its name without reference to the "New Zealand
      Government". For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>    Copyright (c) 2015, Commerce Commission (New Zealand).</code></pre>
    <h3 id="description-of-the-foss-licence-that-applies">
      Description of the FOSS licence that applies
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>78.</strong> The description of the FOSS licence that
      applies to the software either sets out the full terms of the
      FOSS licence or refers to the applicable licence and links to
      full text of the licence. The description may also contain
      statements that exclude warranties and liabilities. Examples
      can be seen in the next part of this Stage 4 below.
    </p>
    <h3 id="applying-the-selected-licence">
      Applying the selected licence
    </h3>
    <p>
      <strong>79.</strong> Agencies can apply their selected
      licence in one of two ways:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <p>
          They can reproduce the full text of the licence, or a
          summary with a link to the full licence, at the top of
          each source code file they are licensing. Here are two
          examples: <strong>Example 1:</strong> if the licensing
          agency were a department and had selected the MIT
          licence, its licensing statement at the top of each
          source code file would look like this:
        </p>
        <pre><code>    MIT Licence

        <p>
          <strong>Example 2:</strong> if the licensing agency were
          a Crown entity and had selected the GPL<a href="#fn21"
          class="footnoteRef" id="fnref21" name=
          "fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> licence, its licensing
          statement at the top of each source code file would look
          like this:

      </li>
      <li>Alternatively, agencies can provide the licence as a
      separate text file (which would contain the full licence
      text) that accompanies the software files, usually in a
      top-level folder. If agencies take this approach:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>the text file containing all the licensing text
          should be called "LICENCE" (or something similar); and
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              the first paragraph of the licensing text that
              identifies the licensor should also identify the
              software to which the licence is being applied, e.g.:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>     SpatialZone Project, Crown copyright (c) 2015, Land Information New Zealand on behalf of the New Zealand Government.</code></pre>
            <p>
              Note that, under this approach, if a single software
              file is separated from the distribution, the
              recipient is unlikely to see the applicable copyright
              notice. If this is of concern to an agency, the
              solution is to include a brief copyright notice in
              each file's header that points to the top-level
              LICENSING file. For example:
            </p>
            <pre>
            <code>     SpatialZone Project, Crown copyright (c) 2015, Land Information New Zealand on behalf of the New Zealand Government. This file is released under the &lt;LICENCE&gt; licence. See the LICENCE file found in the top-level directory of this distribution for more information.</code></pre>

      Introduction
    </h2>
    <p>
      1 The specimen IP warranty and IP indemnity clauses set out
      below are starting points for agencies that wish to act in
      accordance with the "Act fairly towards developers when
      drafting IP warranties and indemnities" Policy Principle in
      NZGOAL-SE. They are designed for insertion into new contracts
      for the development of software where FOSS software might be
      used. They can also be used to amend the standard terms of
      the Government Model Contract for Services (which is done by
      making appropriate insertions into Schedule 2 of that
      Contract).
    </p>
    <p>
      2 The precise drafting of such clauses in any given case, in
      the context of an agency's project and the contract it is
      using, is a matter for the agency. The provision of these
      specimen clauses does not constitute legal advice to any
      agency or person.
    </p>
    <h2 id="context">
      Context
    </h2>
    <p>
      3 It is common for software development contracts to contain
      a warranty clause along these lines:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>1. Service Provider Warranties</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Service Provider represents and warrants that the
      possession or use by the Customer or its Personnel of any
      item of Intellectual Property supplied or licensed by the
      Service Provider will not infringe the Intellectual Property
      rights of any third party.
    </p>
    <p>
      4 It is also common for software development contracts to
      contain IP indemnity provisions that include a clause like
      this (this is just an example; sometimes they are more
      elaborate):
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. IP Indemnity</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The Service Provider will indemnify the Customer against
      all Losses suffered or incurred by the Customer or its
      Personnel as a result of any claim that the possession or use
      by the Customer or its Personnel of the System or any other
      Intellectual Property or materials supplied or licensed by
      the Service Provider under this Agreement infringes any third
      party's Intellectual Property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      5 The specimen clauses set out below are based on the
      assumption that there are such clauses in the development
      contract in question.

    <p>
      <strong>Specimen open source software clause</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      6 The specimen open source software clause set out below:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>requires the service provider to obtain the customer's
      consent before using particular open source software (this is
      not due to any judgement on the use of open source software
      but to enable the customer to be aware of the use of open
      source software and to assess the applicable FOSS licence(s)
      if it wishes);
      </li>
      <li>gives primacy to the FOSS licence(s) used in relation to
      the software they cover;
      </li>
      <li>confers ownership of new software IP on the customer;
      </li>
      <li>qualifies the application of the service provider
      warranty mentioned above to open source software;
      </li>
      <li>requires the service provider to comply with applicable
      FOSS licences; and
      </li>
      <li>requires the service provider to release adapted FOSS
      software or new software designed to interact with FOSS
      software to an open source repository if the agency requests
      it to do so (this does not prevent the agency from doing so
      but some agencies may prefer their service providers to do
      this).
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      7 This is the specimen clause:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>3. Open Source Software</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The Service Provider shall obtain the Customer's written
      consent before providing, incorporating or adapting, or
      developing any widget, plugin or module for, any Open Source
      Software, in the course of its performance and delivering the
      Services and any associated Deliverables. The parties
      acknowledge that the purpose of this requirement is to enable
      the Customer to review the applicable open source licence
      terms, make a decision as to whether those terms are
      acceptable and, should consent be granted, respect any
      obligations in those licence terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) If the Customer grants such consent:
    </p>
    <p>
      (i) the terms of the applicable open source licence(s) will
      apply to that Open Source Software;
    </p>
    <p>
      (ii) the provisions of that licence or those licences will
      prevail over the terms of this Agreement in the event and to
      the extent of any inconsistency;
    </p>
    <p>
      (iii) all Intellectual Property rights in the Open Source
      Software that is supplied to the Customer (or incorporated
      into the System or any other Deliverables supplied to the
      Customer) under this Agreement, or under any collateral
      licence or agreement, remains the sole and exclusive property
      of the relevant third party;
    </p>
    <p>
      (iv) the Service Provider will own the new Intellectual
      Property rights in any adaptation or derivative of the Open
      Source Software and in any widget, plugin or module the
      Service Provider develops under this Agreement that is
      designed to interact with the Open Source Software;
    </p>
    <p>
      (v) the warranty in clause 1 does not apply in relation to
      that Open Source Software unless the Service Provider knows
      or has reason to believe, at the time it selects the Open
      Source Software, that the Open Source Software would, or
      would be likely to, infringe the Intellectual Property rights
      of a third party;
    </p>
    <p>
      (vi) the Service Provider will comply with all applicable
      terms of the open source licence(s); and
    </p>
    <p>
      (vii) if required by the Customer, the Service Provider will
      release:
    </p>
    <p>
      (A) any adaptation or derivative of the Open Source Software
      provided or incorporated into the System; and
    </p>
    <p>
      (B) any widget, plugin or module the Service Provider
      develops under this Agreement that is designed to interact
      with the Open Source Software and is used in the course of
      its performance and delivering the Services and any
      associated Deliverables,
    </p>
    <p>
      to one or more specified online software code repositories
      and under the open source licence that is either:
    </p>
    <p>
      (C) required to be applied to the adaptation, derivative,
      widget, plugin or module by the upstream open source licence;
      or, if there is no such requirement
    </p>
    <p>
      (D) specified by the Customer,
    </p>
    <p>
      provided that the Customer first consults the Service
      Provider for a minimum of 5 business days before exercising
      its right in this clause 3.2(b)(vii).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Specimen modification to IP indemnity clause</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      8 Sub-clause 2(b) in the specimen clause below has the effect
      of limiting the application of the IP indemnity mentioned
      above to open source software that the Service Provider uses
      in providing services and deliverables to the customer. It
      would usually form part of the indemnity clause mentioned
      above. For this reason, that indemnity clause is repeated
      here:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>2. IP Indemnity</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      (a) The Service Provider will indemnify the Customer against
      all Losses suffered or incurred by the Customer or its
      Personnel as a result of any claim that the possession or use
      by the Customer or its Personnel of the System or any other
      Intellectual Property or materials supplied or licensed by
      the Service Provider under this Agreement infringes any third
      party's Intellectual Property rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      (b) Clause 2(a) does not apply to any Losses arising from the
      Customer's possession or use of any Open Source Software,
      unless the Service Provider knew or believed, at the time of
      selecting the relevant Open Source Software, that the
      possession or use by the Customer or its Personnel of that
      Open Source Software would, or would be likely to, infringe
      any third party's Intellectual Property rights.
    </p>
    <h2 id="associated-definitions">
      Associated definitions
    </h2>
    <p>
      The specimen clauses above use various defined terms (these
      are the terms that are capitalised). Not all of the defined
      terms need to be set out here. The relevant defined term for
      present purposes is the definition of Open Source Software.
      There are various ways to define Open Source Software. This
      is one way:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Open Source Software</strong> means any software that
      is released on licence terms that grant others the freedom to
      use, copy, modify and distribute the software, for either
      non-commercial or commercial purposes, as long as they comply
      with the applicable licensing conditions.

            The MIT licence is considered preferable to the BSD
            3-Clause licence (another commonly-used permissive open
            source software licence) because the MIT licence
            includes a clearer grant of rights and expressly
            includes the right to sub-license (the BSD licence does
            not). Whilst many interpret a right to sub-license as
            being implicit in the BSD licence, the absence of an
            express reference to it in the BSD licence could
            produce uncertainty for users, most notably users who
            wish to incorporate government-produced code in a work
            licensed under the GPL. The Free Software Foundation
            considers the BSD licence to be compatible with the GPL
            but that must depend on a particular interpretation of
            the BSD licence wording (see generally A Sinclair
            "License Profile: BSD" IFOSS Law Review, 2(1) pp. 1-6).
            The MIT licence doesn't contain the BSD's 'no
            endorsement' clause but, in most cases, the law would
            prevent claims of endorsement without permission
            anyway. Another common permissive licence, the Apache
            License 2.0, was not chosen because it is more complex.
            The Free Software Foundation considers it preferable to
            the BSD and MIT licences as it deals with patent
            licensing and prevents 'patent treachery'. However, in
            New Zealand the Patents Act 2013 excludes computer
            programs "as such" from patentable subject matter (and,
            in any event, historically government agencies have not
            generally been in the business of applying for software
            patents). NZGOAL-SE could have recommended its own
            bespoke permissive licence instead of the MIT licence
            but that would have contributed to further licence
            proliferation and exposed developers to a licence
            they're not familiar with.<a href="#fnref7">↩</a>

            Whilst versions 2 and 3 of the GPL differ in certain
            respects, in essence the GPL allows people to copy and
            distribute the software, to charge a fee for
            transferring it or providing warranty protection, and
            to modify the software and distribute resulting
            derivative works. And, if a person distributes a
            derivative work, that person needs to license it under
            the GPL, otherwise that person's licence to use the
            software will terminate. The full text of versions 2
            and 3 of the GPL (both versions are in common use) can

            A diverging code fork occurs when agencies make changes
            to the code of open source software without publishing
            the code back to the software's development community.
            The fork is the split between the agency's version of
            the software and the version published by the
            community. Any further changes made by either the
            agency or the community will increase the differences
            of the source code. This can make it difficult for the
            agency to upgrade to a new published version, as the
            agency would have to reapply all its changes. This risk
            may be mitigated by contributing modified source code
            back to the open source software community if
            appropriate.<a href="#fnref12">↩</a>

            A Contributor Licence Agreement, or CLA, is an
            agreement that sets out the terms under which a person
            or entity makes contributions to the project or
            software. A CLA will deal with licensing terms and can
            also agree with topics such as warranties and
            indemnities.<a href="#fnref13">↩</a>

            The 'contributing' file could also seek to obtain a
            warranty (promise) from contributors that they have all
            the rights they require to submit their contributions
            on the terms of the specified licence and an indemnity
            in favour of the agency should it turn out that the
            contributor does not have the required rights. The
            indemnity clause would seek to enable the agency to
            recover, from a contributor, loss the agency incurs as
            a result of the contributor's breach of the warranty.
            NZGOAL-SE suggests, however, that including an
            indemnity could be unnecessary and/or
            counter-productive. Not only could it inhibit
            contributions but it could pose difficulties for
            contributing government departments given restrictions
            on the granting of indemnities under the Public Finance
            Act 1989.<a href="#fnref14">↩</a>

            For example, the software could be a deliverable under
            a services contract the agency has with a vendor, but
            the contract may confer copyright ownership on the
            service provider and only license the software to the
            agency.<a href="#fnref15">↩</a>

            Agencies should note that, even if an agency decides to
            apply the GPL to its source code, the agency can always
            allow particular developers to use it under different
            terms if the agency wishes (as long as the agency is
            the copyright owner). It is conceivable, for example,
            that a New Zealand-based software developer may wish to
            use the code in proprietary software for which it has a
            strong export market. In that sort of case, the agency
            can make the code available to the developer under
            alternative licence terms, e.g. without an obligation
            to share the source code of distributed
            adaptations.<a href="#fnref18">↩</a>
