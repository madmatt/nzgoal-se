          to these as the "IPR Guidelines" from now on in this
          guidance. The IPR Guidelines help agencies determine who
          should own the copyright in newly developed software code
          by a supplier.

          New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing
          framework - Software Extension (2016)</a> - we will refer
          to this as "NZGOAL-SE" from now on in this guidance.
          NZGOAL-SE helps agencies correctly license publicly
          funded software code using an open source licence when
          they have decided to do so.

      </li>
    </ol>
    <ol start="5" style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          The IPR Guidelines default position is that suppliers
          should own the copyright in newly developed software
          code. The reasoning is that the government is not in the
          business of commercialising software. In certain limited
          situations the default can be overridden, one of these
          being that <em>"the agency intends to allow free use of
          the [software] on open source terms"</em><a href="#fn1"
          class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
          "fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Open source licensing allows
          commercialisation opportunities of software code by
          anyone under the open source licence terms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If an agency decides <em>"yes, we intend to allow free
          use on open source terms"</em> then the IPR Guidelines
          recognise that an agency may wish to own new intellectual
          property rights in the software that is to be procured.
          This can be important because, as the NZGOAL-SE review
          and release process notes, an agency that wishes to
          release software under an open source software licence
          needs to consider whether it has sufficient rights to do
          so. If the agency owns the intellectual property rights
          in the software and has not exclusively licensed it to
          someone else, it usually will have sufficient rights. In
          some cases the same result might be achieved by obtaining
          a sufficiently broad licence from the supplier that
          allows release on open source terms but this path can be
          more complicated and involve more paper work.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The IPR Guidelines do not contain guidance on what to
          consider when deciding whether to release software under
          an open source software licence. They also contain little
          guidance as to when and how to communicate to suppliers
          an agencyâ€™s intention to release procured software on
          open source terms (as that was not their purpose). These
          two aspects are addressed in this Guidance Note.

          The following diagram demonstrates how agencies can
          respect the IPR Guidelines during a software procurement
          while incorporating a decision to release the procured
          software under an open source software licence. Note that
          it only considers the interaction between the IPR
          Guidelines and release of software on open source terms
          under NZGOAL-SE. There may be other reasons as to why an
          agency wishes to own procured software but they are not
          relevant to this Guidance Note.

          This Guidance Note advises agencies to weigh up potential
          motivations for releasing software on open source terms
          alongside any concerns they may have in relation to
          releasing on open source terms. Agencies may also
          discover the potential value of the software code
          proposed during the procurement process so itâ€™s important
          to be open and communicate well with respondents to
          notices of procurement.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Open source licensing of government procured software
          code in New Zealand is <strong>not mandated</strong>.
          Itâ€™s left up to individual agencies to consider and an
          informed decision to license their software on open
          source terms.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Agencies are encouraged to document the rationale for
          their decisions, regardless of whether they decide to
          release the procured software under an open source
          software licence.

          Open source licensing of software code does not guarantee
          it will have superior security to code developed under a
          proprietary model or vice versa. A bug is a bug, and no
          software style is immune. However, making the code openly
          available may result in expert attention being given to
          it by experienced developers in the community that might
          not be available internally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Releasing software code does not mean releasing data the
          software uses, configuration of the software in
          production or other sensitive credentials. Security or
          privacy-sensitive code or configuration layers should not
          be released and NZGOAL-SE recognises that itâ€™s Open
          Access and Licensing Principle does not apply if release
          of the software on open source terms would create an
          unacceptable security risk or an unacceptable
          privacy-related risk. A key point to note here is that,
          through good design, it will often be possible to
          separate security or privacy-sensitive code or
          configuration layers (not to be released) from the rest
          of the code that can be released.

          you might consider not releasing the code. However, as
          noted, you may be able to isolate sensitive code from the
          more general reusable code, releasing only the latter

          rule 61 of the Government Rules of Sourcing contains a

          Considering your decision to open source license may
          occur as early as an initial investment proposal or
          building a business case. Your considerations may be
          informed through discussions with internal stakeholders,
          other agencies and with suppliers through pre-market

          Once you have decided that your agency intends to release

          You may be putting together a business case or request
          for information (RFI) to help define the problem you are
          trying to solve with your software development project.
          Framing your project as a user problem to be solved,
          rather than specifying a technical solution at this early
          stage is useful. It's at this stage that your decision to
          release the project as open source may also be informed
          as you learn more about the project characteristics. You
          might also investigate the "Prepare" and "Discovery"

          For example, you may discover existing government open
          source solutions that fit your needs (or at least in
          part). In this case your project may reuse and build upon
          existing code, configuring it to your specific need and
          contributing back any resulting new software code.
          Alternatively, you may find out that the problem you are
          solving is being faced by other agencies and nothing
          currently exists to solve it. Here the reusability of the
          open source software code would be valuable to release
          and communicating early to other agencies would avoid
          duplication, give rise to a potential co-funding

      APPENDIX: Communicating open source software licensing and
      release in Request For Proposals
    </h2>
    <p>
      Agencies are encouraged to include the following paragraphs
      in their Requests For Proposals (RFPs) once they have decided
      to release procured software code under an open source
      software licence. Communicating this is consistent with
      <a href=
      "http://www.procurement.govt.nz/procurement/for-agencies/key-guidance-for-agencies/the-new-government-rules-of-sourcing/6-other-rules-you-need-to-know#rule61">
      Rule 61 (Intellectual Property) of the Government Rules of
      Sourcing</a> and the <a href=
      "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/procurement-advice/guidelines-for-the-treatment-of-intellectual-property-rights-in-ict-contracts/aim-statement/">
      Statement of Policy set out in the Guidelines for Treatment
      of Intellectual Property Rights in ICT Contracts</a>. The
      paragraphs are written on the assumption that a draft
      contract is attached to the RFP and that the draft contract
      confers ownership of new intellectual property rights on the
      procuring agency. The specimen clause for use in RFP below
      has been adapted from <a href=
      "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-guidance-notes/nzgoal-guidance-note-3/">
      NZGOAL Guidance Note 3: Procuring copyright works</a><a href=
      "#fn19" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref19" name=
      "fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> and reads as follows:
    </p>
    <pre><code>1.  Copyright and licensing

    a.  Respondents should note that [name of procuring agency] will
        own copyright in new copyright works created as a result of
        this procurement and may elect to release and license them for
        re-use in accordance with the New Zealand Government Open
        Access and Licensing framework Software Extension (NZGOAL-SE)
        under:

          i. for software, a free and open source software licence; and

          ii.for documentation, a Creative Commons licence.

        Except as indicated below, respondents should not seek to
        alter the intellectual property provisions in the draft
        contract attached to this RFP that confer ownership of new
        intellectual property on [name of procuring agency].

    b.  Respondents may, however, have a legitimate interest in being
        able to re-use such copyright works before [name of procuring
        agency] licenses them for re-use in accordance
        with NZGOAL-SE. Where that is the case, respondents should
        request an appropriate licence from the procuring agency
        allowing them to do so.

    c.  If a respondent feels there is overwhelming commercial or other
        reason as to why it must own the copyright in new copyright
        works under the contract, it should raise this with [name of
        procuring agency]. The respondent should expect that, if
        [name of procuring agency] allows the respondent to own
        copyright in new copyright works, [name of procuring agency]
        will require a licence to [name of procuring agency] that
        allows [name of procuring agency] to use the works for any
        purpose and to sub-license them for re-use under one or more
        of the licences referred to in NZGOAL-SE.</code></pre>

            Consider here that the longer a software project stays
            closed the more difficult it is to make open later.
            Developing in the open ensures code is produced in a
            way that is more maintainable as an open source project
            going forward. See <a href=
