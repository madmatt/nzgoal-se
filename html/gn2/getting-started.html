      Don’t repeat yourself
    </h2>
    <p>
      A key concept of using or maintaining an open source project
      is the "Don’t repeat yourself" (DRY) rule. Here are a few
      guidelines to help you through the process of finding
      software that already exists that you can make use off before
      developing from scratch.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          When building a new feature for an existing project check
          to see if someone has already done the same and reuse it.
          A quick search using the name of the software and a short
          description of the feature you are looking to develop
          will usually help you discover existing code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          You might also search in other public software
          directories such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>

      <li>
        <p>
          Keep an open mind, you may find that parts of your
          feature exist already in existing libraries. If you find
          part of what you intended to build ask yourself if you
          could reuse it in part part and build further on top of
          it to develop the feature you need.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Before selecting existing code to reuse, examine how well
          maintained it already is:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Does the maintainer answer comments on the code?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Has there been a commit to the code recently?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is there a tagged stable version?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is there any documentation?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Are issues or support requests going unanswered?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It’s a good practice to base your new developments on
              maintained existing code, however if the code is not
              well maintained and you find it still solves your
              problem you may want to consider maintaining it
              yourself as a derivative version.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          In the case of an abandoned repository of code, try and
          at least contact the maintainer.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              You may be able to adopt the original repository and
              become its new maintainer (or co-maintainer with
              others). This is preferable over "forking" the code
              (taking a copy of it and developing it in parallel).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The ideal is for improvements to end up in the
              original repository however sometimes you have no
              choice (for example if the code has been abandoned or
              not actively maintained).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="where-and-how-to-publicly-release-your-code">
      Where and how to publicly release your code?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Part of the open source process involves putting your code
      online in an openly accessible way (not just a zip file on
      your agency website). You will want to ensure there is a
      process for others (and your own team) to contribute
      improvements to this code, raise issues and control the
      collaborative development process. Agencies should look to
      make use of existing code management tools wherever possible
      (NZGOAL-SE advocates for this) to enable others to find and
      reuse the code also to avoid the operational costs of running
      such an ICT system. There are online repositories (both free
      and paid) as well as self-hosted options available (should
      you wish to operate your own code repository).
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the available options include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a>(as a service or
          self-hosted)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://bitbucket.org/">Bitbucket</a>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href=
          "https://gitlab.cwp.govt.nz/explore/projects">Common Web
          Platform</a> (for New Zealand Government users of this
          shared service)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href="https://git.nzoss.org.nz/">NZOSS</a> (free
          community run GitLab repositories from the New Zealand
          Open Source Society)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href=
          "https://www.drupal.org/node/648898">Drupal.org</a> (for
          Drupal themes and modules)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Which ever option you choose, you’ll want to ensure that it
      is easy for external parties to interact with. If a
      contributor has an important fix to your software and cannot
      submit it or find the contact details for you as the
      maintainer, then that work may never see the light of day and
      the benefit of community contributions of open source is
      lost.

    <h3 id="setting-up-an-organisation-account">
      Setting up an organisation account
    </h3>
    <p>
      When setting up a code repository account to make your public
      open source releases, agencies should avoid signing up for an
      individual user account. It is recommended to set up an
      organisational account (in some code repositories these are
      called "groups"). You can then assign access to individual
      developer accounts within that organisation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Organisation account have the advantage of:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Being able to organise a number of open source projects
          in one central location.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Managing the permissions of many individual developer
          accounts (internal teams, contractors or external
          community members) to an organisation's open source
          projects.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ensure open source projects are not tied to one
          individual and are available into the future (even as
          staff come and go from the projects).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For example, the <a href="https://github.com/GOVTNZ">govt.nz
      website team have a GitHub organisation</a> grouping all the
      open source licensed code they have released in one place,
      they assign individual developer access to these projects
      when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When working with external contractors or across agencies,
      giving them read or write access to your repository is
      encouraged. It facilitates the flow of ideas and builds
      stronger community support around your open source projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      Add the additional and removal of developer access to your
      staff/contractor induction and exit processes. Ideally, have
      someone like a team lead or IT manager that is savvy with
      code repository account management hold the administrator
      access to the organisation account so that they can add or
      remove staff when required (otherwise you may need to
      document the process and make available to your HR team).
      Don’t give admin rights to the organisation account to anyone
      but your agency staff.
    </p>
    <h3 id="individual-user-accounts">
      Individual user accounts
    </h3>
    <p>
      Government and contractor developers should use individual
      accounts when committing their code changes and responding to
      contributors. They should assign their ".govt.nz" email
      address to the account. This helps to keep an audit trail of
      the work history and shows others which code has come from
      the official government maintainer of the project. It’s
      important to maintain transparency when developing code in
      the open and this helps everyone contributing to the project
      know who to contact when working with an open source project.
      If you already have an account with the code management tool
      in use for the project, rather than making a new account you
      can often associate your “.govt.nz” email address to your
      account as a secondary email.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are signing up for a new account:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
      <li>
        <p>
          Sign up and associate your ".govt.nz" email as the
          primary address for the account.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Complete your profile including your image, bio etc so
          others can get to know you better when working on open
          source projects with you.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If available, set up two-factor authentication to keep
          your account secure.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Request your team to be add you to the organisation
          account that has been set up.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Ensure that any notifications from the project go to your
          ".govt.nz“ email .
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Respect any agency or project specific code of conduct.
        </p>
      </li>
