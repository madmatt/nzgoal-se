      Documentation is an important part of releasing your work as
      open source. This helps users get started, understand what
      your code does and how they might make use of it. Good
      documentation clearly answers questions that users have -
      either by informing or by instructing them.<a href="#fn1"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
      "fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>

      General points about technical documentation
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Document your code for your own future reference (because
          it’s in the open others will benefit too), chances are
          one day you’ll thank yourself (and your team).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Some documentation is better than none. Leave
          documentation "stubs" (pages with headings of known areas
          not documented), this helps by providing a clear place to
          contribute documentation and shows you are aware of what
          is and isn’t complete. It is common practice in open
          source to accept things as incomplete as long as this is
          pointed out to users.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Understand that documentation is never really finished,
          it will evolve as your code does.<a href="#fn2" class=
          "footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>

          You cannot write a Frequently Asked Questions from
          scratch; as it says on the tin, they require you to
          actually answer questions from real users that come up
          often with real world use of your project. Document as
          you learn.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Bundle your documentation alongside your code in a
          standard format (<a href="#markdown">Markdown format is
          useful here</a>); this makes it easy to update as code is
          improved.

      <li>
        <p>
          Always include at least a README document in the root of

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Talk to your users if you can to find out what they need

      Types of documentation

          <strong>Tutorials</strong> - Step-by-step guides that
          instruct your user how to do something specific with your
          code. This might be a detailed walkthrough of getting
          started or how to accomplish a common coding task. They
          should be short, easy to complete (and not too easy that
          learning doesn’t occur) and should demonstrate what it’s
          like to work with your project’s code.

      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Guides</strong> - These will form the main bulk
          of your documentation. They are used to describe and
          inform users about the concepts and features you’ve
          included in your software. These might also include some
          code snippets to help explain concepts. Aim for
          completeness, a user should be able to feel like they
          have a good grasp on a particular aspect of your software
          after reading these guides.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Reference material</strong> - This details your
          softwares public APIs (methods and classes) that
          developers can make use of when adapting to suit their
          needs. Developers use these guides to look up the
          arguments and implementation specifics of your code so
          the audience is likely more technical. Reference material
          is not a substitute for good well written guides and
          tutorials.

      Markdown documentation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use a open standard format when writing your documentation so
      that anyone can read it. A standard format widely used for
      documentation is called Markdown.<a href="#fn4" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> It’s
      easy to learn , small in file size and captures both the
      content and formatting. Markdown can be used for outputting
      many other formats, for example you can use it to produce
      HTML for websites, PDF and Docx for print, or even Epub for
      e-readers while keeping a single source of truth, the
      Markdown source.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markdown documentation is treated exactly the same as code in
      your version control system - you can track the changes over
      time, many developers are able to work on it at the same time
      and merge changes together once ready to release.
    </p>
    <p>
      Markdown is a text file and saved with the file extension
      ".md", you write your content using plain text and use a set
      of plain text “marks” to represent the format of your
      document.
    </p>
    <h4 id="example-of-markdown-format">
      Example of markdown format
    </h4>
    <p>
      An example of Markdown looks like this when writing it:
    </p>
    <pre><code>    # My documentation

    This is a paragraph of text talking about my work and how you might make use of it as a developer. You’ll note paragraphs need no extra formatting.

     * Here I’ll make a bullet point

     * And another

     * One more

     1. An ordered list of numbers

     2. Another number

    ## Here is a sub heading

    ### And a sub, sub-heading

    [Here is a link](https://ict.govt.nz)</code></pre>
    <p>
      Markdown is rendered into human readable html pages. For
      example the above Markdown would render as follows when
      viewed online as part of your code repository:
    </p>
    <h1 id="my-documentation">
      <strong>My documentation</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>
      This is a paragraph of text talking about my work and how you
      might make use of it as a developer. You’ll note paragraphs
      need no extra formatting.
    </p>
    <ul>

      There are several <a href=

    <p>
      We recommend learning and making use of Markdown for
      government open source documentation and if a document copy
      (PDF/Docx) is required then these can be generated from the
      source material using several <a href=
      "https://github.com/alanshaw/markdown-pdf">open</a> <a href=

    </p>
    <h4 id="markdown-metadata">
      Markdown Metadata
    </h4>
    <p>
      Another great aspect of Markdown format is you can also
      include metadata directly within it. You might use this to
      provide additional information to users about the nature of
      the documentation contained in the document. Markdown
      metadata is 3 dashes followed by key/value pairs at the top
      of your document before you start the first paragraph, closed
      with a final 3 dashes. Any metadata standard can be
      represented, it would be suggested to use of a few commons
      attributes like "title" and “description” and you might also
      implement an existing open metadata standard such as <a href=
      "http://dublincore.org/documents/usageguide/elements.shtml">Dublin
      Core</a>.

      Your first release of documentation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Documenting a new project can be daunting, ideally you can
      split up this task by documenting features as you code them
      though this is not always practical. For you first set of
      documentation we recommend that you limit the scope to a few
      key aspects:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Your README (as described above)
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Create one tutorial that walks new users through a common
          task or use of the software. This helps show the user
          what can be done and gets them thinking about how they
          might use your code.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Describe what you know is missing from the documentation
          (you might also created "stub" pages for these).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You don’t need to set any expectations as to when these will
      get written, it’s acceptable in open source to simply ensure
      users are aware of any shortcomings and then they can choose
      you use your code anyway and they are free to contribute any
      improved documentation.
    </p>
    <h3 id="structuring-your-documentation-pages">
      Structuring your documentation pages
    </h3>
    <p>
      It’s a good idea to use a consistent structure when you have
      documentation that spans several separate pages and topics. A
      skeleton structure for a section of your documentation might
      look like this:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Metadata.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Heading (descriptive enough to tell the reader what topic
          is covered).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Short summary of what the reader will get out of reading
          the document.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Main body of the content, using sub-headings and a style
          guide to make it easy to read.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Short summary of points or review at the end.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Optional "related" documents or link to the next topic
          the user should read.
        </p>

    </ul>
    <h3 id="writing-style-guide">
      Writing style guide
    </h3>
    <p>
      To keep your documentation easy to use and consistent the use
      of a writing guide is a good idea. Your agency may already
      have its own set of writing guides in which case you might
      use this. Alternatively you could look to reuse the <a href=
      "https://www.govt.nz/about/our-style-guide/">Govt.nz writing
      style guide</a> as it is a good example of ensuring writing
      is accessable and in plain English while allowing the use of
      technical terms which are unavoidable in software
      documention.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Other general points for technical writing styles
      are:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Important information goes first.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use an active voice - tell the reader what you want them
          to do or what they are learning.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Know and write for your audience.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Keep sentences short.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid superlatives, keep technical writing clear and
          concise it’s about delivering information to your users.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use callouts for really important information.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Things to avoid:</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Losing the reader by not getting to the point quickly.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Making the reader feel stupid by using lots of jargon or
          technical terms without first defining them (unless
          you're certain of your audience).
        </p>
