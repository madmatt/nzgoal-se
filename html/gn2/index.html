      Technical practices for developers working with open source
      projects in government
    </h2>
    <p>
      These guidance notes cover technical practices for developers
      working on government maintained open source software
      projects or when working with external open source projects
      with other developers as part of a wider open source
      community. It follows on from the NZGOAL Software Extension
      open source licensing policy for the New Zealand Government
      as during the public consultation on this policy it was
      raised as a need to help with the actual technical aspects of
      releasing open source licensed software.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to note that alongside the technical
      considerations in this guidance note, you should also
      familiarise yourself with the communication and community
      management aspects of open source which are available in a
      separate guidance note. Part of developing an open licensed
      project requires the ability to engage in dialogue about your
      work, code out on the open, give and receive feedback and
      interact with contributors in public while using modern
      software development practices to produce and maintain the
      project’s code base over time.
