      Safe configuration practices
    </h2>
    <p>
      When releasing your code as open source software, ensure that
      you have not included any sensitive credentials in the
      publicly released code itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Database logins
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          API keys
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Configuration setting specific to your production
          deployment
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          User account details
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      A issue here is that if you are using version control, once
      one of these details has been commented to the repository, it
      stays in the history forever (unless you remove the project
      history and start with a fresh commit of code but you will
      lose a wealth of project history information doing this).
    </p>
    <p>
      A good practice to adhere to here is building a configuration
      layer into the software that you write. In your software code
      you can then write in references to the variables contained
      within the configuration file without exposing the values
      themselves. This make the software code much safer to share
      under an open source licence. You might also provide an
      example configuration file that users can duplicate before
      they configure their own copy of the software.
    </p>
    <h2 id="release-early-and-often">
      Release early and often
    </h2>
    <p>
      Part of the value of developing code in the open is to
      'release early, and often'<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref1" name="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. When working on
      code in public, it is acceptable to have code that is not yet
      ready for production (work in progress, often <a href=
      "#semantic-versioning">indicated by the version number</a>.
      This is how bugs can be caught and fixed early, improving the
      quality of the code before it is put into production.
    </p>
    <p>
      Government open source projects have potential to be harmed
      by waiting for a particular event to occur before they are
      made publicly available. The longer the project is run closed
      prior to open sourcing it, the more difficult it will be to
      open.
    </p>
    <p>
      At each step in a project, developers face a choice:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          do something in a manner compatible with a hypothetical
          future open sourcing; or
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          do it in a manner incompatible with open sourcing (eg
          hard-coding an API key).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every time the latter is chosen, the project gets just a
      little bit harder to open source. Sometimes you can't help
      choosing the latter occasionally. It's very difficult to give
      a future event the same present-day weight as, say, fixing
      the incoming bugs reported or finishing a new feature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in an open source project is part of the version
      history and exposed when you finally open source it. Cleaning
      this up prior to releasing takes time and resources that
      might have been avoided if the project had been open from the
      beginning.
    </p>
    <h2 id="version-control">
      Version Control
    </h2>
    <p>
      Version control is like track-changes for documents but much
      more useful. It allows multiple people to work on the same
      code simultaneously and avoids having to pass the work back
      and forth in order for individuals to make their changes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using version control allows you to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Iteratively build up your software over time.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Revert to an earlier version whenever you want to.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Record your changes and the reasons why you made them, to
          help future developers understand the process.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Work on changes in parallel as a team before merging them
          together (See <a href="#working-in-branches">Working in
          branches</a>).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Tag stable releases of code using meaningful version
          numbers (See <a href="#semantic-versioning">Semantic
          Versioning</a>)
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="distributed-version-control-systems">
      Distributed version control systems
    </h2>
    <p>
      <a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> has become one of the
      most widely used version control systems. Git is a
      distributed version (DVCS) as it allows many developers to
      work simultaneously on the same project code by allowing
      multiple, distributed copies of the work and incremental
      improvements to contributed to an agreed copy of the code
      (usually in a publicly accessible code repository).
    </p>
    <p>
      It's a good idea to use a DVCS for government open source
      projects as they are useful in managing both internal work
      and wider external contributors using the same set of
      software development processes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is because:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          everyone involved in the process has a full copy of the
          code and its history
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          it’s easier for developers to create ‘branches’ in their
          code to explore new features or approaches without
          encroaching on others work
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          developers can continue to work when the network is
          unavailable, making small incremental commits, merging
          their changes back with everyone else’s at a later date

    <p>
      When committing new code to your version control, make sure
      commits only relate to one feature or specific set of
      changes. Keep the commits as small as possible (while still
      achieving the outcome of the patch). An ideal commit is a
      cross-section of work including: the code for the patch,
      tests for the change (if relevant), documentation relating to
      that change. As a government open source project maintainer,
      set a good example in your commits and ask other developers
      that contribute to do the same. It will help with peer review
      and maintenance of the project over time<a href="#fn2" class=

    <h3 id="what-makes-a-good-commit-message">
      What makes a good commit message?

    <p>
      Your commit messages act as an audit trail for your code so
      be sure that if you looked back over these in a year's time,
      they would still make sense to you. More importantly, would
      they make sense to any new team members that may join in the
      future?
    </p>
    <p>
      Write a commit message like you’re trying to explain it to
      your future self. Generally a good commit message contains
      the following<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"
      name="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>:
    </p>
    <ul>

          Short subject line (max. 50 characters).
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          Capitalised without a trailing full stop.

      <li>
        <p>
          Written in the imperative (i.e. an instruction on
          <em>how</em> it was done), for example "<em>Fix bug</em>"
          (correct) vs. “<em>Fixed bug</em>” (incorrect).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          If you need to explain more in your commit message, use
          the commit body text.

    <h2 id="working-in-branches">
      Working in branches
    </h2>
    <p>
      It's a good rule of thumb to keep your "master" branch in a
      production ready state. At any time you should be able to
      safely deploy or install the "master" and have the current
      stable version of your software running. This means that
      practices such as contributing new code directly to the
      master branch should be avoided. Use branches and pull
      requests to achieve code improvements.
    </p>
    <p>
      New features can be tested in separate branches without
      interrupting the main project releasability. People need the
      freedom to try new things without feeling like they're
      interfering with other's' work.There are times when code
      needs to be isolated from the main project branch, for
      example getting a bug fixed or stabilising a new release
      without worrying about tracking the moving target of daily
      development activity. Developers need to be able to review
      and comment on experimental work, treating branches as
      first-class, publishable objects makes this possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Quick tips for branches</strong>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use branches liberally.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Encourage others on your team or contributing to the
          project externally to use them.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid long running branches, that is, build your feature
          in small iterations and merge back frequently.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Watch out for branches becoming a mechanism for dividing
          the development community's efforts (the eventual goal of
          branches should be to merge changes back into the master
          and disappear, as soon as possible not hang around for a
          long time).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Use a branching approach that doesn't add undue overhead
          to getting work completed. For example a large project
          might make use of a branching standard called
          "GitFlow"<a href="#fn4" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4"
          name="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>, this might add too much
          undue process if the project is small (in which case you
          might simply use feature branches<a href="#fn5" class=
          "footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>
          and pull requests to merge to master).

      Why peer review in public?
    </h3>
    <p>
      Peer reviewing is an important process for teams building
      software. The benefits when peer review is carried out in
      public are magnified as the potential pool of people
      available to give constructive feedback is wider. This helps
      in a number of ways.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          It can improve the quality of the software in a
          measurable way eg reduced bugs per month by a percentage
          because of peer reviewing.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Keeps a record of past software architecture decisions
          (you can go back and discover why something was done,
          this is good for new team members to get up to speed on
          projects).
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Keeps your software releasable, less chance of avoidable
          bugs making it into your master branch if the peer review
          picks it up before merging.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The team and wider community gets to learn about new code

      Coordinated disclosure of security issues
    </h2>
    <p>
      A coordinated disclosure is designed to improve security of
      software systems and protect the public. It does this by
      ensuring that reporters of these issues are treated
      respectfully when they inform agencies of issues and that
      both parties (your agency and the reporter) work together in
      a responsible manner, in good faith and within the law to
      correct the issue and then let others know about it so they
      can update their own systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s important to ensure that external contributors know how
      to correctly contact you if they discover a security
      vulnerability in your open source software. Your organisation
      should respond in good faith to the reporter and encourage
      these type of reports being made safely for all involved.
    </p>
    <p>
      You should have a process in place for this in the form of a
      Coordinated Disclosure policy which informs contributors how
      they should let you know about security related issues
      (rather than publicly disclosing them) and how you will work
      with them to resolve the issue that they have disclosed to
      you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some suggestions when you publish your open source software:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Read over the <a href=
          "http://www.nzitf.net.nz/pdf/NZITF_Disclosure_Guidelines_2014.pdf">
          New Zealand Internet Task Force Coordinated Disclosure
          guidance</a>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Put in place a coordinated security policy at your
          agency.<a href="#fn6" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref6"
          name="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Publish your policy on your agency’s website and link to
          it in your software code repository documentation to
          ensure contributors can contact you about security
          related issues.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Include a summary of what contributors should do when
          they find a security issue in your code in your
          CONTRIBUTING.md documentation alongside your code. A
          sample insert for this is provided below.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Set up an email such as "security@AGENCY.govt.nz" that
          can be used to report issues (you may also look into
          ensuring this can be done securely by providing a public
          encryption key<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id=
          "fnref7" name="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Respond promptly and in good faith to reporters of
          security issues (within 2 days is suggested), inform them
          as to what the next steps in the process are to get the
          issue resolved. Remember they have gone to the effort of
          letting you know about something important to your
          security and privacy, work with them to get the issue
          resolved and both parties should take a "do no harm"
          approach.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Once you agree with the reporter that there is an issue
          to be fixed, keep the reporter informed as your work on
          the fix (a simple update email once a week to the
          reporter would be appropriate) to show you’re acting and
          haven’t gone silent on the matter. Try and stick to any
          timeframes you set to build trust with the reporter.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Check your system for any signs of it being compromised
          and then fix the issue.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          NZGOAL-SE suggests informing other agencies known to be
          using your software, the CGIO, the GCPO and the Office of
          the Privacy Commissioner so the widest number of users
          get the opportunity to apply the fix to the software
          before it becomes publicly disclosed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Lastly, release your fix directly to your publicly
          accessible code repository (and consider applying a
          security patch version number as discussed in the
          <a href="#semantic-versioning">section on Semantic
          Versioning</a> along with an advisory note or CHANGELOG
          in your project documentation informing users of the
          known issue and prompting them to update.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Publicly acknowledge the reporter for helping with the
          fix (if they agree).

      Semantic Versioning
    </h2>
    <p>
      In order to indicate to other developers the status of
      publicly released code, your project can adopt <a href=
      "https://semver.org"><strong>Semantic Versioning
      (SemVer)</strong></a>, that is, version numbers that have a
      meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      SemVer is a three point versioning open standard in the
      format of "X.Y.Z". For example, <a href=
      "http://ckan.org/">CKAN</a><a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref9" name="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> is version
      <a href="https://github.com/ckan/ckan/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#v252-2016-03-31">
      <strong>2.5.2</strong></a> using the SemVer standard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's detail what these numbers mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>"Z"</strong> refers to a “security” version which
      indicates a bug or security fix has been added to the code
      and you should look to upgrade as soon as possible. Security
      releases should be backwards compatible with the current
      minor version, that is, they should be able to be installed
      without interrupting any additional customisations you may
      have made to a minor version of the software. The security
      release version changes the most frequently of the 3 levels.
      In our CKAN example, there have been 2 security patches
      applied to the current released version as you can see from
      the number on the right of the version (X.Y.2).
    </p>
    <p>
      The** "Y"** indicates a “minor” version and indicates that
      new features have been added and they will be backwards
      compatible with previous minor versions. For the CKAN example
      here, you can read the middle number and quickly find out
      that this is the 5th minor version of the software (X.5.Z)
      and this version should be compatible with version 2.4.0 all
      the way back to 2.0.0 or any future versions such as 2.6.0
      for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <strong>"X"</strong> indicates a "major" version and
      changes if the code undergoes a major rewrite with backwards
      <em>incompatible</em> changes. Major versions indicate to
      developers that they will need to do some work when upgrading
      the version of the software if they have made any
      customisations. From the CKAN version number on the left
      (2.Y.Z), you can find out that there have been 2 major
      versions of the software released.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putting out CKAN example together we can quickly get an
      understanding as a developer that there have been have 2
      major versions, 5 minor versions of the major version and 2
      security patches to the latest minor version - hence version
      <strong>2.5.2.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      When first releasing an open source project publicly it is
      common to use version 0.1.0 and begin to increment from this
      point forward. This indicates that there is no major stable
      version yet ready for production. Over time as incremental
      contributions are made and the code is improved, tested and
      deemed ready to use in projects the semantic version would
      increment to 1.0.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      SemVer tagging is widely practiced standard in the wider open
      source software community and recommended for government open
      source projects to help communicate to external contributors
      valuable information about the project status.
    </p>
    <h2 id="testing-in-open-source-projects">
      Testing in open source projects
    </h2>
    <p>
      Testing in any software project is useful as it helps ensure
      that software does what it is supposed to do. In context of
      an open source project, this is even more important as
      contributors to the project may be external and have less
      context about the inner workings of the software than the
      original maintainers.
    </p>
    <p>
      While we won’t talk specifically about how to write tests for
      specific applications (the scope depends on your project and
      is too wide to cover here), manually testing can be very time
      consuming so it is a good practice to set up an automated
      suite of tests. This helps determine if any potential changes
      to the code will cause it stop functioning as it is supposed
      to <em>before</em> changes make it into the released version
      of the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called often referred to as Regression testing (and
      there are a number of other types you may want to look into
      for your project including Unit testing and
      Behavioural/functional testing).
    </p>
    <p>
      Regression testing becomes useful as the size and complexity
      of your project grows. There is a trade off of the time to
      write the tests versus code for the application itself. Here
      you need to use judgement and test appropriately for the size
      and importance of the features in your open source project.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is common practice in open source projects to require that
      contributors ensure any existing tests pass before their
      changes are accepted. It’s also preferred that they
      contribute tests for new code they write and submit. Again,
      in this case be careful that requiring tests with every
      contribution doesn’t bottleneck the process of contribution
      itself (you want to encourage not hinder people efforts). You
      might want to describe what type of code changes do or do not
      require testing explicitly in your project documentation so
      contributors know when they need to write these.
    </p>
    <h3 id="automating-your-testing">
      Automating your testing
    </h3>
    <p>
      Many existing public code repositories include or can
      integrate with automated regression testing tools (referred
      Continuous Integration or CI). These can often be set up free
      of charge for open source projects and help external
      contributors see when a change they propose might affect the
      software working as intended.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are using branches and pull requests as part of your
      development workflow, most CI tools run your tests whenever a
      new change is proposed via a branch or pull request. CI tools
      can also block the change from being merged into the code if
      the tests are failing which avoids bugs making their way into
      the software to begin with.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following are some available tools often used for
      automated testing in open source projects.

      Travis CI integrates with GitHub repositories to run your
      tests automatically, whenever new code is pushed to a branch.
      To set up your project to work with GitLab CI you include a
