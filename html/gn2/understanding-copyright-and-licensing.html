      Understanding copyright and licensing
    </h2>
    <p>
      As a developer working with open source projects, it’s
      important to have an understanding of copyright and
      licensing, how they differ and how you use them for open
      source release.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section will give a simple overview of copyright,
      licensing and some considerations when contributing to open
      source projects or accepting contributions into your own
      government open source projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This section is not a substitute for robust legal advice and
      every edge case. For a fuller understanding of open source
      licensing please read over the <a href=

    <h3 id="copyright">
      Copyright
    </h3>
    <p>
      Copyright is a set of property rights that automatically come
      into existence when you write software code. Copyright
      applies to the actual product of the work, not the idea to
      produce the work. Open source projects are grounded in
      copyright, there is an owner and this owner can decide what
      happens to the work, for example, licensing it under open
      source terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you create work while employed or are commissioned to
      write software (as a contractor) then the owner of the
      copyright is the entity that you did the work on behalf of,
      you don’t personally hold the copyright in this situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In terms of code created in or on behalf of the New Zealand
      Government (the "Crown"), unless contracted out of ( that is,
      arrangements made in the contract to alter the default):
    </p>
    <p>
      "the Crown is the first owner of any copyright subsisting in
      any work created by a person who is employed or engaged by
      the Crown, under a contract of service, apprenticeship, or a
      contract for services" (Crown Copyright, 2014).
    </p>
    <p>
      This is called <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_copyright#New_Zealand">"Crown
      Copyright"</a> and means the NZ Government as a whole owns
      the copyright in the code (and the agencies look after it on
      the Crown’s behalf).
    </p>
    <p>
      Other agencies could make use of this Crown Copyright code,
      however Crown Copyright doesn’t apply to some organisations
      in Government. Crown Entities and State-owned Enterprises for
      example are excluded from Crown Copyright when they create
      works (in this case the Crown Entity itself is the copyright
      owner). In this situation , in order for the widest reuse
      across NZ Government in the simplest way, you can license the
      code using open source licences as set out in NZGOAL Software
      Extension.
    </p>
    <h3 id="licensing">
      Licensing
    </h3>
    <p>
      Licensing is related to copyright but is a distinct concept.
      Licensing concerns itself with two things: who "owns" the
      code, and who has the right to use it. The author of software
      code holds the code's copyright (in terms of government this
      is usually Crown Copyright as mentioned above), and are the
      copyright holder. If they would like to let others reuse the
      code, they need to grant them a "license" to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open source licenses grant a set of rights normally reserved
      for the copyright holder (hence the term "all rights
      reserved" you often see in association with copyright) to
      another person. For instance, the right to use, copy, modify,
      or redistribute.
    </p>
    <p>
      This license is provided in writing along with the code (in
      the LICENSE file) and states the terms under which the code
      may be used to the world at large, you don’t have to ask
      permission specifically. Most common licence types are the
      "copyleft" and the “permissive” and there are many licences
      you can use that fit into these two categories.
    </p>
    <p>
      For government open source projects we recommend the use of
      one of two licenses, the GPL or the MIT. See <a href=
      "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/nzgoal-se-review-and-release-process/">
      NZGOAL Review and release process</a> which sets out in more
      detail the legal aspects of selecting and applying an open
      source licence.
    </p>
    <h3 id="accepting-contributions-from-the-community">
      Accepting contributions from the community
    </h3>
    <p>
      Project documentation should clearly state the license under
      which code is distributed and that any code publicly
      contributed to (e.g. pull requests, code comments or patches)
      must be licensed under the same terms. This is not uncommon
      in open source projects and is referred to as "terms of
      contribution" in a CONTRIBUTING file alongside the code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under such terms, either the individual contributor will
      retain the copyright, and their publicly distributed code is
      licensed under the same terms as the code they are
      contributing to. NZGOAL Software Extension recommends this
      approach and suggests the <a href=
      "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/#contributions">
      following insert you can use in your CONTRIBUTING file</a>:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>The source code for this [name of project or software] is licensed under the [insert name of applicable free and open source software licence]. By contributing source code to this [name of project or software], you are agreeing to license your contributions under and on the terms of the [insert name of same licence]. Please note that your licence is irrevocable and royalty-free. You or your licensors retain any copyright in your contributions while allowing others to re-use the source code in any way they like as long as they meet the requirements of the licence.</code></pre>
    <p>
      Alternatively, the project maintainer may request that
      copyright be assigned to them at such time they will license
      the code under the same terms as the repository so the
      contributor can still make use of their contributions along
      with all other users. Note, NZGOAL Software Extension
      <strong>doesn’t recommend this second approach</strong> as it
      can been seen as "over-reaching" in its position as copyright
      holder of externally contributed code.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either way the copyright is managed for contributions, the
      rights and freedoms of the shared code remain the same, all
      can reuse, copy, modify and redistribute because of the
      overall open source licence the project is released under
      allows this.

      What do contractors need to know about copyright and
      licensing?
    </h3>
    <p>
      As a contractor doing work for New Zealand Government
      agencies, it's important to be aware that unless you have
      explicitly stated in your services contract that you will be
      the owner of any copyright material you produce while working
      for the New Zealand public sector then the agency that
      commissions you to do the work, owns the copyright in the
      work you produce for them for the duration of the contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is stated in legislation under the New Zealand Copyright
      Act 1994:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Where—</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>
            <em>a person commissions, and pays or agrees to pay for
            ... the making of a computer program … ; and</em>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote>
        <ol start="2" style="list-style-type: decimal">
          <li>
            <em>the work is made in pursuance of that
            commission,—</em>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>that person is the first owner of any copyright in the
        work.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Subsections (2) and (3) apply subject to any agreement
        to the contrary.</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id=
        "fnref1" name="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      This is referred to as the <em>"commissioning rule"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      This is also mirrored in the New Zealand Government Model
      Contracts (GMC) that are commonly used when agencies hire
      contractors. The Intellectual Property section of this says:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>12.2 New Intellectual Property Rights in the
        Deliverables become the property of the Buyer when they are
        created.</em><a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"
        name="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      As a contractor then you need to ensure you have the agencies
      permission to release the code you work on under an open
      source licence. Remember, you need to own the copyright in
      order to grant freedoms under an open source licence.

      NZGOAL-SE puts forward a default set</a> of well used open
      source software licenses for the release of government open
      source code. These are the GNU General Public Licence (GPL)
      and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) licence.
      When licensing most new software as open source these two
      licences should cover most use cases.
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be special cases where circumstances may require
      the use of an alternative open source software licence.
      NZGOAL-SE section 69 allows for this scenario by putting
      forward two alternative licences; the Lesser General Public
      Licence and the Affero General Public Licence; suggesting
      particular use cases as to when you might use these. You can
      also make use of any of the available open source licenses so
      long as you can justify why you would use these in place of
      the recommended default set (GPL or MIT) from NZGOAL-SE.
      Below are short descriptions of some of the alternative open
      source software licences you may opt to use and links to find
      out more information.

      Permissions of this copyleft license are conditioned on
      making available complete source code of licensed works and
      modifications under the same license (LGPL) or the GPL.
      Copyright and license notices must be preserved. Contributors
      provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger
      work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by
      the licensed work may be distributed under different terms
      and without source code for the larger work.
    </p>
    <p>
      An example use of LGPL is if the source code to be released
      is a library of code and the agency knows that there are
      proprietary software suppliers who wish to use the agency's
      particular library within, or to link the library to, their
      own proprietary source code without having to release (or it
      being argued that they have to release) their proprietary
      code if they distribute their software. The GNU Lesser
      General Public Licence (LGPL) will allow this kind of use
      without exposing the downstream user to risk. The LGPL
      requires software licensed under it to be modifiable by end
      users through source code availability and does not require
      proprietary code that is linked to the LGPL-licensed library
      to be made available under the GPL.

      This strong copyleft license is focused on making available
      complete source code of licensed works and modifications,
      which include larger works using a licensed work, under the
      same license (AGPL). Copyright and license notices must be
      preserved in the source code. Contributors provide an express
      grant of patent rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sharealike obligation in the GPL (i.e., the obligation to
      license one's adaptations under the GPL) is triggered upon
      distribution of an adaptation. Where software is installed on
      a server to provide a service to end users (e.g., in an
      application service provider or cloud services context), the
      sharealike obligation is not triggered. To some people this
      seemed like a loophole.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GNU Affero General Public Licence (AGPL) was designed to
      close that loophole. It is based on the GPL and states that
      if source code is adapted then the "public use of a modified
      version, on a publicly accessible server, gives the public
      access to the source code of the modified version".
    </p>
    <p>
      There may be cases in which an agency is open source
      licensing software that is used on servers where the agency
      would like to achieve this result or where communities of
      interest ask the agency to achieve this result. If so, the
      agency may wish to select the GNU Affero General Public
      Licence (AGPL) instead of the GPL.
