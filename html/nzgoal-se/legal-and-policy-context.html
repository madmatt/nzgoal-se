      Copyright law
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>8.</strong> Key aspects of copyright law relevant to
      open licensing generally are set out in the NZGOAL Copyright
      Guide.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
      "fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Additional aspects relating
      specifically to software include the following:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <strong>copyright exists in original</strong>
        <strong>software</strong>: software is a form of "literary
        work" and original literary works are a category of works
        in which copyright exists (section 14(1) of the Copyright
        Act 1994 and the section 2(1) definition of "literary
        work");
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>infringement</strong>: as such, unless entitled to
        do so by a copyright licence or statutory provision, a
        person infringes copyright in software that that person
        does not own when he or she does any of a number of
        "restricted acts", the most common of which is copying the
        work or a substantial part of it or adapting the work;
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>adaptations</strong>: an "adaptation", in relation
        to a literary work that is a computer program (i.e.,
        software), includes "a version of the program in which it
        is converted into or out of a computer language or code or
        into a different computer language or code, otherwise than
        incidentally in the course of running the program" (section
        2(1));
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>first owner of copyright</strong>:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
          <li>
            <strong>employee-employer relationship</strong>: when
            employees create software for their employer in the
            course of employment, the employer is the first owner
            of copyright in the software unless the employment
            contract states otherwise. This is the case where the
            employer is the Crown (section 26) and where the
            employer is another person, agency or entity (section
            21(2));
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>service provider-customer
            relationship</strong>: when a service provider creates
            software for a customer under a contract for services,
            the customer is the first owner of copyright in the
            software unless the contract for services states
            otherwise. Again, this is the case where the customer
            is the Crown (section 26) and where the customer is
            another person, agency or entity (section 21(3)).

      Guidelines for Treatment of Intellectual Property Rights in
      ICT Contracts
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>9.</strong> These Guidelines<a href="#fn2" class=
      "footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> are
      relevant where an agency procures the development of software
      from a service provider. They state that only in limited
      circumstances should the government own and exploit new
      intellectual property rights (<strong>IPR</strong>) created
      under an ICT contract. The default position is that the
      supplier should own the new IPR, with licences being granted
      to the customer agency and other State Services agencies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>10.</strong> This position could create an obstacle
      to an agency licensing developed software on open source
      terms because the agency can only do so if it has the
      requisite rights to do so. If it doesn't own the copyright,
      it doesn't have the requisite rights unless expressly
      authorised by the copyright owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>11.</strong> The Guidelines recognise, however, that
      there may be situations where an agency needs to own the IPR.
      One of those situations is where the agency "intends to allow
      free use of the IPR on open source terms". Agencies would,
      therefore, be acting consistently with these Guidelines if
      they were to require the development contract to confer
      ownership of copyright in the software on the agency, on the
      basis that they wish to license the software on open source
      terms.<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3" name=

    <p>
      <strong>12.</strong> Who is to own the copyright in new
      software is a significant issue that needs to be considered
      at the time of procuring the software development services, a
      point that is made clear in Rule 61(1) (Intellectual
      Property) of the Government Rules of Sourcing.<a href="#fn4"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name=
      "fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> That Rule states:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If an agency's procurement of goods, services or works
      involves the supplier creating new Intellectual Property, the
      agency <strong>should</strong> set out, in its Notice of
      Procurement, its intentions regarding ownership, licensing,
      and future commercialisation of that Intellectual Property."

            Where the agency owns the copyright, it could still
            grant a non-exclusive custom licence to the service
            provider, before or at the same time as releasing the
            software on open source terms, that enables the service
            provider to use the software for other purposes. For
            example, the service provider may wish to be able to
            use the software it has developed for other projects
            before the agency releases it on open source
            terms.<a href="#fnref3">↩</a>
