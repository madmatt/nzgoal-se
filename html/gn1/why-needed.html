      4 When considering development of custom software from a
      supplier there are two policy documents to consider:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href=
          "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/procurement-advice/guidelines-for-the-treatment-of-intellectual-property-rights-in-ict-contracts/">
          Guidelines for Treatment of Intellectual Property Right
          in ICT Contracts (2008)</a> - this is referred to in the
          Government Rules of Sourcing, rule 61 and we will refer
          to these as the "IPR Guidelines" from now on in this
          guidance. The IPR Guidelines help agencies determine who
          should own the copyright in newly developed software code
          by a supplier.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <a href=
          "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/">
          New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing
          framework - Software Extension (2016)</a> - we will refer
          to this as "NZGOAL-SE" from now on in this guidance.
          NZGOAL-SE helps agencies correctly license publicly
          funded software code using an open source licence when
          they have decided to do so.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      5 The IPR Guidelines default position is that suppliers
      should own the copyright in newly developed software code.
      The reasoning is that the government is not in the business
      of commercialising software. In certain limited situations
      the default can be overridden, one of these being that
      <em>"the agency intends to allow free use of the [software]
      on open source terms"</em><a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef"
      id="fnref1" name="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. Open source
      licensing allows commercialisation opportunities of software
      code by anyone under the open source licence terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      6 If an agency decides <em>"yes, we intend to allow free use
      on open source terms"</em> then the IPR Guidelines recognise
      that an agency may wish to own new intellectual property
      rights in the software that is to be procured. This can be
      important because, as the NZGOAL-SE review and release
      process notes, an agency that wishes to release software
      under an open source software licence needs to consider
      whether it has sufficient rights to do so. If the agency owns
      the intellectual property rights in the software and has not
      exclusively licensed it to someone else, it usually will have
      sufficient rights. In some cases the same result might be
      achieved by obtaining a sufficiently broad licence from the
      supplier that allows release on open source terms but this
      path can be more complicated and involve more paper work.
    </p>
    <p>
      7 The IPR Guidelines do not contain guidance on what to
      consider when deciding whether to release software under an
      open source software licence. They also contain little
      guidance as to when and how to communicate to suppliers an
      agency’s intention to release procured software on open
      source terms (as that was not their purpose). These two
      aspects are addressed in this Guidance Note.
    </p>
    <p>
      8 The following diagram demonstrates how agencies can respect
      the IPR Guidelines during a software procurement while
      incorporating a decision to release the procured software
      under an open source software licence. Note that it only
      considers the interaction between the IPR Guidelines and
      release of software on open source terms under NZGOAL-SE.
      There may be other reasons as to why an agency wishes to own
      procured software but they are not relevant to this Guidance
      Note.
