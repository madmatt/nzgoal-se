      1 This guidance note is to help government agencies
      understand:

    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <p>
          Considerations that are relevant to deciding whether to
          release new software code produced by a supplier
          (procured) under an open source software licence.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When and how to communicate to suppliers during the
          procurement process should agencies decide to release
          code under an open source software licence.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          How to make use of the two current policies relating to
          software code procurement and open source as an end to
          end process.

      <li>
        <p>
          Cover the treatment of copyright in newly developed works
          that are not software code (other than documentation that
          accompanies the code). These are dealt with in <a href=
          "https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-guidance-notes/nzgoal-guidance-note-3/">

      3 You should use this guidance when:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">

        <p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>

          NZGOAL-SE principles and release process.
