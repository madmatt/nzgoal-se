      9 This Guidance Note advises agencies to weigh up potential
      motivations for releasing software on open source terms
      alongside any concerns they may have in relation to releasing
      on open source terms. Agencies may also discover the
      potential value of the software code proposed during the
      procurement process so it’s important to be open and
      communicate well with respondents to notices of procurement.
    </p>
    <p>
      10 Open source licensing of government procured software code
      in New Zealand is <strong>not mandated</strong>. It’s left up
      to individual agencies to consider and an informed decision
      to license their software on open source terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      11 Agencies are encouraged to document the rationale for
      their decisions, regardless of whether they decide to release
      the procured software under an open source software licence.

        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      13 The final decision on whether to release procured software
      on open source terms will depend on your agency’s particular
      circumstances and the nature of the software in question.

      Motivations to release government open source software
    </h2>
    <p>
      14 The following sets out potential motivations for releasing
      procured software (that an agency owns or has sufficient
      rights to release) under an open source software licence.
    </p>
    <h3 id=
    "newly-developed-software-code-is-a-public-asset-and-can-reduce-duplication-costs">
      Newly developed software code is a public asset and can
      reduce duplication costs
    </h3>
    <p>
      15 One point of view is that newly developed, publicly-funded
      software should be treated as a public asset. Open source
      licensing allows legal reuse of this public asset and each
      reuse multiples the value of the public funds that
      contributed to its development (as the same code does not
      need to be developed more than once).
    </p>
    <h3 id=
    "agency-know-how-may-be-embedded-in-the-code-itself-and-open-source-release-may-grow-and-attract-it-talent">
      Agency know-how may be embedded in the code itself and open
      source release may grow and attract IT talent
    </h3>
    <p>
      16 In some cases your agency’s technical know-how and
      processes may be captured through their having been embedded
      into the developed software code. Where this is the case,
      open source licensing of this code may:
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>
        <p>
          facilitate ongoing access to and retention of this
          knowledge when technical staff move on, as having the
          code and documention in an open source software
          repository makes it more accessible (this can be
          particularly valuable in specialist knowledge domains in
          which there are limited practitioners); and
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          releasing such code may help grow local IT talent and
          attract quality staff for an agency when required (being
          able to work on open source projects as part of one’s job
          can be a draw card and many organisations now look at
          developer candidates’ public code contributions as part
          of the technical recruitment process).
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="more-technical-support-options">
      More technical support options
    </h3>
    <p>
      17 Releasing code under an open source licence can allow a
      wider range of suppliers to study, develop and offer support
      services to agencies in relation to the code<a href="#fn1"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1" name=
      "fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. This can also encourage
      competition in the market (as there is a choice of suppliers
      and low exit costs due to reduced vendor lock-in). Open
      source release in a public repository also maintains access
      to the code into the future should a supplier of this code
      stop trading or is acquired.

      The more code is reused, the more shared the maintenance
      efforts
    </h3>
    <p>
      18 A rule of thumb with open source software is that <em>what
      gets reused, gets maintained</em>. You might consider
      breaking down procured deliverables into modular components
      containing your agency's specific business logic (less
      desirable for others to reuse and potentially not suitable to
      open source license) and more generic components able to be
      built upon further by others (good candidates for open source
      licensing).

      You’d like to grow a community around your open source

    </h3>
    <p>
      19 An advantage of a growing open source community is that
      other users can help share the load of answering technical
      questions about the software. Don’t underestimate the effort
      required to build a thriving open source software
      community<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2" name=
      "fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>. You might consider starting small
      and increasing community engagement over time.

    <p>
      20 An open and transparent software development process
      releases code early and builds it up iteratively in a public
      repository. This process can be used to help catch bugs, make
      it easier to maintain over time and improve reliability of
      the software<a href="#fn3" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref3"

    <p>
      21 In can be important for citizens to be able to see how
      something they interact with works and that, in turn, may
      foster trust that they are being treated fairly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take for example, a digital public service that provides a
      calculation. If the business rules or calculations are not
      sensitive and do not raise any identifiable security or
      privacy risk then the code that produces the calculation
      could be released on open source terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      An added benefit of this is that having calculations
      expressed in reusable code can improve consistency of this
      calculation across a range of software, both open source and
      proprietary. In some cases open source can also be used
      strategically to gain adoption of open standards and
      facilitate interoperability.

    <h3 id="speed-up-government-digital-service-provision">

      22 There is a move by governments internationally to what is
      referred to as a Government as a Platform<a href="#fn4"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref4" name=
      "fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> approach to digital services
      delivery. Agencies combine modular and reusable components of
      software and open data to deliver digital government services
      to citizens more quickly and iteratively improve them over
      time<a href="#fn5" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref5" name=
      "fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.Open source licensing makes the
      reuse of digital service delivery components easier by
      reducing the transaction costs of acquiring and assembling
      the required components to deliver digital services to the
      public. Currently, the New Zealand Government ICT Strategy
      and Action Plan can be seen as supporting this approach as it
      calls for more "common capabilities" and that "common service
      components are re-used by agencies"<a href="#fn6" class=

    <h2 id="concerns-about-open-source-licensing-of-software">
      Concerns about open source licensing of software
    </h2>
    <p>
      23 The below sets out and assesses potential concerns
      agencies may have in relation to releasing procured software
      under an open source software licence.
    </p>
    <h3 id="what-about-security-and-privacy">
      What about security and privacy?
    </h3>
    <p>
      24 Open source licensing of software code does not guarantee
      it will have superior security to code developed under a
      proprietary model or vice versa. A bug is a bug, and no
      software style is immune. However, making the code openly
      available may result in expert attention being given to it by
      experienced developers in the community that might not be
      available internally.
    </p>
    <p>
      25 Releasing software code does not mean releasing data the
      software uses, configuration of the software in production or
      other sensitive credentials. Security or privacy-sensitive
      code or configuration layers should not be released and
      NZGOAL-SE recognises that it’s Open Access and Licensing
      Principle does not apply if release of the software on open
      source terms would create an unacceptable security risk or an
      unacceptable privacy-related risk. A key point to note here
      is that, through good design, it will often be possible to
      separate security or privacy-sensitive code or configuration
      layers (not to be released) from the rest of the code that
      can be released.
    </p>
    <p>
      26 If there is an identifiable security risk or the code
      forms a critical system for government and exposes security
      enforcing functions<a href="#fn7" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref7" name="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> you might consider
      not releasing the code. However, as noted, you may be able to
      isolate sensitive code from the more general reusable code,
      releasing only the latter under an open source licence.
    </p>
    <h3 id=
    "we-dont-want-to-be-burdened-with-maintenance-time-and-contributor-questions-after-the-release">
      We don’t want to be burdened with maintenance time and
      contributor questions after the release
    </h3>
    <p>
      27 This concern may exist when you do not have an internal
      technical support team or if the team doesn’t have the
      experience with the software programming language used or may
      not have time to field questions from the community. You may
      be able to mitigate this concern by up-skilling or training
      but that may raise cost considerations and is a matter for
      each agency to decide.
    </p>
    <p>
      28 Note that the Department of Internal Affairs or the
      Ministry of Business, Innovation &amp; Employment may have a
      relevant common capability, syndicated or all-of-government
      contract in place that agencies can sign up to, without
      needing to conduct their own primary procurement exercise, if
      they wish to obtain support in relation to software they
      release. See ict.govt.nz and procurement.govt.nz for details.
    </p>
    <p>
      29 If you do have a team that would be capable of supporting
      your released open source code, remember that you open source
      license your code, not your time and attention<a href="#fn8"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref8" name=
      "fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and that you can set expectations
      in your documentation for other contributors. Dialogue with
      contributors in open source projects are often informal in
      nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      30 Note that, while you might be able to set expectations as
      to how frequently you will reply, some questions about the
      software may be considered requests for official information.
      In such cases the Official Information Act 1982 would usually
      apply.
    </p>
    <p>
      31 Releasing your code doesn’t cause a flood of interaction
      to occur. Your commitment to interaction with the open source
      community may change over time if the software becomes well
      used. You could also consider using or relying upon trusted
      external contributors to help share the maintenance and
      answer questions.

    <h3 id="were-worried-about-licensing-legal-obligations">
      We’re worried about licensing legal obligations

    <p>
      32 NZGOAL-SE was created to help make the open source
      licensing process straightforward for government agencies. It
      includes a detailed set of principles, a review and release
      process and specimen contract clauses for IP indemnity and
      warranties agencies can insert into contracts with suppliers.
      Open source licensing is grounded in copyright, if you need
      assistance you should consider consulting your legal team.

    <p>
      33 If you don’t have internal technical support for software
      you’re thinking of releasing under an open source software
      licence, you have the option of talking to suppliers in the
      market about providing this support for you. Suppliers can
      study the software and offer commercial service offerings
      (usually training and support) around it due to its openly
      accessible nature <a href="#fn9" class="footnoteRef" id=
      "fnref9" name="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a>.

    <h3 id=

      Suppliers might charge more if they don’t get to own the
      copyright or know that the software will be released for all

    </h3>
    <p>
      34 While a valid concern, the IPR Guidelines are clear in
      stating that cost saving is usually not a sufficient reason
      for accepting a restricted licence (from supplier to agency)
      because accepting cost savings as a valid reason could: :
    </p>
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
      <li>reward vendors for deliberately tendering an unrealistic
      all-of-government price while offering a realistic single
      agency licence price; or
      </li>
      <li>incentivise agencies to take a purely self-interested
      approach, at the expense of the government as a whole.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Suppliers may still be able to commercially exploit the
      software under the terms of the open source licence.
    </p>
    <h3 id=
    "its-not-in-the-national-interest-to-release-the-software-code-on-open-source-terms">
      It’s not in the national interest to release the software
      code on open source terms
    </h3>
    <p>
      35 You may consider that the open source release of
      government software might compete directly with and unfairly
      impact local technology suppliers who developed the code or
      who have a similar commercial offering. Note, however, that:
      a. local suppliers themselves would be able to make use of
      the software and compete on service provision rather than
      selling code; and b. releasing publicly funded software under
      an open source software licence could accelerate and improve
      government digital services and (as noted above) be seen as
      aligning with the New Zealand Government ICT Strategy and
      Action Plan.
    </p>
    <p>
      36 Potentially against that, another consideration is that
      accelerator<a href="#fn10" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref10"
      name="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> or catalyst<a href="#fn11"
      class="footnoteRef" id="fnref11" name=

      events<a href="#fn12" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref12" name=

      private-public initiatives and open government data<a href=
      "#fn13" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref13" name=
      "fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a>. Private sector retention and
      exclusive commercial exploitation of software code produced
      through these may be an incentive for participants to take
      part (though some events require code to be open source
      licensed).

      37 All open source licenses include liability exclusions and
      warranty disclaimers as part of the licence terms. They state
      that the party releasing the code will not be liable for the
      consequences of its use and that it is not giving any
      warranties in relation to the software.
