<p>Each Policy Principle is set out below.</p>
<h2 id="open-access-and-public-release-of-agency-software-using-free-and-open-source-licences">Open access and public release of agency software using free and open source licences</h2>
<p><strong>14.</strong> If government agencies have the required copyright-related rights to do so, and wish to license their software source code for re-use, they are encouraged:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> to consider making their source code, that is or may be of interest or use to people, available for re-use under a FOSS licence as further described in these Policy Principles and in accordance with the NZGOAL-SE Review and Release Process and decision
        tree, unless an exception in paragraph 18 applies; and </li>
    <li> if they decide to do so, to:
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
            <li> use existing version control systems and source code repository platforms to allow for discussion and improvement of released software;<a id="fnref6" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6"><sup>6</sup></a> and </li>
            <li> make the software publicly accessible by releasing it online; and </li>
            <li> use existing, freely available software to interact with the released software source code </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>(the <strong>Open Access and Licensing Principle</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>15.</strong> For the purposes of NZGOAL-SE, the recommended set of free and open source software licences for which selection guidance is provided are:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> the <strong>MIT licence:</strong><a id="fnref7" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7"><sup>7</sup></a> this is a more permissive licence in the sense that it does not contain a sharealike obligation that would require adaptations to be licensed under the
        same terms if distributed (the full text of the MIT licence can be found on the website of the <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"><em>Open Source Initiative</em></a>)<a id="fnref8" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8"><sup>8</sup></a>; and
        </li>
    <li> the <strong>GPL licence:</strong> this is sharealike/copyleft licence that requires those who adapt the source code to release their adaptations on the same terms if they distribute them (the full text of the GPL licence can be found on the website
        of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html"><em>Free Software Foundation</em></a>).<a id="fnref9" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9"><sup>9</sup></a> </li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="ensuring-copyright-ownership-or-right-to-sub-license">Ensuring copyright ownership or right to sub-license</h2>
<p><strong>16.</strong> Paragraph 14 makes it clear that, for the Open Access and Licensing Principle to apply, an agency must have the required copyright-related rights to license the software.</p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> Agencies should only license software for re-use by others under a FOSS licence where:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> they own or can obtain an assignment of all copyright in the software and have not exclusively licensed it to a third party; or </li>
    <li> to the extent they do not own the copyright, they have or can obtain permission from the copyright owner(s) to do so </li>
</ol>
<p>(the <strong>Rights Clearance Principle</strong>). It can be important, in this context, to check whether developers have reused tracts of code from elsewhere and, if they have, to assess the licences that apply to those tracts to ensure the agency has
    all the rights it needs.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="exceptions">Exceptions</h2>
<p><strong>18.</strong> The Open Access and Licensing Principle does not apply where:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> <strong>civil wrongs</strong>: open source licensing of the software would constitute a breach of contract, breach of confidence, breach of privacy, disclosure of a trade secret or other actionable wrong; </li>
    <li> <strong>commercial interests</strong>: open source licensing of the software would be contrary to an agency's own or the Government's legitimate commercial interests (note, however, that most government agencies are not in the business of commercialising
        developed software); </li>
    <li> <strong>security or privacy risk</strong>: release of the software on open source terms would create an unacceptable security risk (whether to an agency, organisation or individuals) or an unacceptable privacy-related risk. </li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="adaptations">Adaptations</h2>
<p><strong>19.</strong> In the course of its activities, an agency may incorporate or adapt pre-existing software source code that is licensed under one or more FOSS licences. Alternatively, an agency may produce new software source code that interacts with
    a pre-existing FOSS-licensed application. Take a plug-in or extension to an existing application as an example. Depending on the context, a plug-in or extension may be an adaptation of pre-existing source code (e.g., where it has forked an old plug-in
    or extension) or it may be new source code designed to interact with a pre-existing application but without taking any pre-existing source code. If an agency proposes to release its source code in these kinds of situations, the agency should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> respect the terms and conditions of the existing licences (such as attribution requirements); and </li>
    <li> where possible, use the same free and open source licence or licences applying to the pre-existing software source code, even in cases where - strictly speaking - it is not required to do so </li>
</ol>
<p>(the <strong>Respect Existing Licences Principle</strong>).</p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> It is important to note that using more permissively-licensed source code (e.g., MIT-licensed source code) and sharealike/copyleft-licensed source code (e.g., GPL-licensed source code) together in a broader project may require you
    to release your new source code under the same sharealike/copyleft licence or a compatible licence (in most cases the licence will be version 2 or 3 of the GPL)<a id="fnref10" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10"><sup>10</sup></a> rather than under the
    more permissive licence. Whether this is the case depends on the circumstances. Legal advice should be sought if required.</p>
<p><strong>21.</strong> Difficult legal questions can arise as to whether a given piece of developed software, that in some way leverages or interacts with other software, is in fact an adaptation or derivative of that software. If:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> an agency's developed software does leverage or interact with other software; and </li>
    <li> that other software, or part of it, is software owned by a third party that has been released under a sharealike open source software licence like the GPL, </li>
</ol>
<p>the agency should be cautious about concluding that its developed software is <em>not</em> an adaptation or derivative of the other software. The need for caution arises because if the agency concludes mistakenly that the developed software is not an
    adaptation, release of the developed software under an incorrect licence could result in the agency breaching third party rights and expose it to the risk of complaint or legal action. End users would also be at risk of breaching third party rights
    and be exposed to the risk of complaint or legal action. If an agency is in any doubt on this issue, it should seek specialist advice (which could be both technical and legal) before releasing the software for re-use.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="security-code-review">Security code review</h2>
<p><strong>22.</strong> Before releasing software for re-use, agencies should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> consider whether there is any prospect that the code or associated files may contain sensitive elements that may need to be removed prior to release; and </li>
    <li> if there is such prospect, have the code and any associated files security-reviewed before release. </li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="no-additional-controls-or-discrimination">No additional controls or discrimination</h2>
<p><strong>23.</strong> When releasing developed software under an open source software licence, agencies must not seek to impose controls or requirements, whether contractual or otherwise, that are inconsistent with the freedoms or permissions granted by
    the selected licence. For example, agencies are <em>not</em> able to license software under an open source software licence and then seek to discriminate between individual, not-for-profit and commercial uses of the software.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="no-charging">No charging</h2>
<p><strong>24.</strong> Government agencies that release software under open source software licences should not seek to charge people for access to the software.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="updating-foss-licensed-software">Updating FOSS licensed software</h2>
<p><strong>25.</strong> If an agency:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> publicly releases software on open source terms; and </li>
    <li> subsequently identifies a bug or other issue with the software that could have a material adverse effect on users of the software, the agency should (subject to paragraph 26): </li>
    <li> consider whether to inform users of the software of the bug or other issue (e.g., by adding a notice to the repository, site or service that contains the software files); and </li>
    <li> if the agency has rectified the bug or other issue for its own purposes, release the updated file(s) to the relevant repository, site or service. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>26.</strong> If the agency is aware:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> of a bug or other issue that creates a risk to the security of sites or services using the software or to the confidentiality or privacy of information held by those sites or services; and </li>
    <li> that other government agencies are using the software, </li>
</ol>
<p>the agency should inform the Government Chief Information Officer (and where relevant the Government Chief Privacy Officer and Office of the Privacy Commissioner) as soon as possible, take all reasonable steps to inform the other agencies of the risk
    and give them time to mitigate the risk before making any public announcement that could result in people with malicious intent or crackers<a id="fnref11" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11"><sup>11</sup></a> exploiting the bug or other issue. Agencies
    may also wish to consider including a Coordinated Disclosure Policy<a id="fnref12" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12"><sup>12</sup></a> in an accompanying "contributing" file to set expectations as to how the reporting of security risks ought to be
    handled.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="contributions">Contributions</h2>
<h3 id="agency-contribution-to-foss-communities">Agency contribution to FOSS communities</h3>
<p><strong>27.</strong> Where an agency has re-used and adapted pre-existing free and open source software source code or has developed new code to interact with free and open source software source code, the agency should:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> consider asking the free and open source software community or the software source code owners whether any agency adapted feature or improvements or the agency's new source code would generally be re-usable by others (if this isn't already clear);
        </li>
    <li> if so, contribute their adapted or new source code back to the free and open source software community project unless an exception listed in paragraph 18 applies; and </li>
    <li> avoid using a diverging fork<a id="fnref13" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13"><sup>13</sup></a> copy of the software source code when it could reasonably use the upstream source code and contribute agency adaptations of it back to the community for
        general re-use </li>
</ol>
<p>(the <strong>Contribute to FOSS Communities Principle</strong>).</p>
<h3 id="agency-acceptance-of-contributions-from-others">Agency acceptance of contributions from others</h3>
<p><em>Contribution guidance and files</em></p>
<p><strong>28.</strong> Part of the value of releasing free and open source software in accordance with the Open Access and Licensing Principle is that external contributors can re-use and contribute back improvements to agency-released software source code.
    To accept contributions from external contributors in a manner that enables contributions to be licensed properly and shared with others, agencies should consider providing explicit contribution guidance to users that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> explains any technical aspects of making the contributions; </li>
    <li> sets expectations for users as to how the agency will review and accept contributions of source code; </li>
    <li> sets out any code of conduct, moderation policy or terms of use that apply when external contributors engage publicly in discussions about the agency-released software source code; </li>
    <li> indicates whether external contributors need to physically sign and return a contributor licence agreement<a id="fnref14" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14"><sup>14</sup></a> or other document before the agency will accept contributions from them, or
        specifies that the act of contributing source code means the contributing user is agreeing to license his or her contributions to the agency and others under a specified FOSS licence; and </li>
    <li> ensures that users know that they must own the copyright in their contributions or be permitted to license them to the agency and others under the licence that the agency specifies (this is important as it seeks to mitigate the risk of the agency
        accepting and publishing external contributions that, for copyright reasons, should not be accepted and published). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>29.</strong> In the open source software context, a common means of providing this contribution guidance to users is by including a 'contributing' file in documentation that accompanies the source code. It is important that this file (or other
    document if an alternative approach is used) is brought to the attention of users before or at the time they submit contributions. Some source code repositories bring the existence of a 'contributing' file to the attention of users at the time of
    submission but if an agency is not using such a repository it should take care to ensure the terms of contribution are brought to users' attention.</p>
<p><strong>30.</strong> Whilst this is a decision for agencies, NZGOAL-SE suggests that it will usually be unnecessary, administratively burdensome and potentially counterproductive to require contributing users to physically sign and return a formal contributor
    licence agreement or other document. In most cases agencies will be able to secure the rights they need, with sufficient confidence, by including the 'contributing' file mentioned above in documentation accompanying the source code and ensuring that
    this file is brought to users' attention before or at the time of submitting their contributions. Agencies should seek advice from their legal teams if required.</p>
<p><em>Comment on assignment versus licensing</em></p>
<p><strong>31.</strong> Agencies may wish to note that there are two ways in which an agency could obtain the rights it needs from contributors. An agency could require contributing users to assign (i.e., transfer) any copyright in their contributions to
    the agency or it could require contributors to license their contributions to the agency and others under a specified FOSS licence. The advantage of seeking assignments of copyright is that this enables the party maintaining the source code to own
    it all. That makes it easier to take action against a user who does not comply with the applicable FOSS licence terms. The significant disadvantage of seeking assignments of copyright is that it can inhibit contributions (as developers may wish to
    retain their copyright). In a government context, it could also be seen as 'over-reaching'. An assignment also needs to be "in writing signed by or on behalf of the assignor" (section 114 of the Copyright Act 1994). It will be evident from the approach
    suggested above that NZGOAL-SE does <em>not</em> recommend that agencies seek to obtain assignments of copyright in users' contributions. Rather, the suggested approach allows contributors to retain their own copyright and only requires them to license
    their contributions under a specified FOSS licence.</p>
<p><em>Suggested licensing text for 'contributing' file </em></p>
<p><strong>32.</strong> NZGOAL-SE suggests that agencies include the following kind of licensing text in their 'contributing' file or other documentation that they bring to the attention of users before or at the time of source code submission (the content
    in square brackets needs to be completed):</p> <pre><code> Copyright and licensing  The source code for this [name of project or software] is licensed under the [insert name of applicable free and open source software licence]. By contributing source code to this [name of project or software], you are agreeing to license your contributions under and on the terms of the [insert name of same licence]. Please note that your licence is irrevocable and royalty-free. You or your licensors retain any copyright in your contributions while allowing others to re-use the source code in any way they like as long as they meet the requirements of the licence. </code></pre>
<p><strong>33.</strong> Agencies may also wish to ensure that the 'contributing' file, or other document that is brought to the attention of users, contains the matters referred to in paragraph 28(a)-(e) above.<a id="fnref15" class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="obtaining-rights-when-procuring-or-commissioning-the-development-of-software">Obtaining rights when procuring or commissioning the development of software</h2>
<p><strong>34.</strong> When procuring or commissioning the development of software, government agencies should consider whether they may wish to release the software to the public for re-use under an open source software licence. If the answer is yes, agencies
    should consider the steps that may be required as part of their procurement and contracting processes to ensure that either:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> they have the relevant rights to release the software under an open source software licence; or </li>
    <li> that the developer will release the software under a specified open source software licence. </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>35.</strong> Such steps may include:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> ensuring the agency owns the intellectual property rights in the developed software; or </li>
    <li> ensuring the agency obtains a broad licence from the service provider allowing the agency to sub-license the software under the MIT licence or GPL (or, if required, some other free and open source software licence); or </li>
    <li> insisting on contractual provisions that require the service provider to release the software under a specified open source software licence (and, where relevant, to a specified code repository). </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>36.</strong> Taking these steps may require:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> the inclusion of appropriate paragraphs in a notice of procurement (where applicable); and/or </li>
    <li> the inclusion of specific contractual provisions in a draft contract; or </li>
    <li> where an existing panel supply arrangement is being used, a review of the intellectual property provisions in the panel contract and, if required and possible, amendments to them for the purposes of the software development in question; and </li>
    <li> ensuring that the contract does not include confidentiality provisions that would inadvertently prevent release of the software under an open source software licence. </li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="act-fairly-towards-developers-when-drafting-ip-warranties-and-indemnities">Act fairly towards developers when drafting IP warranties and indemnities</h2>
<p><strong>37.</strong> If:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
    <li> a government agency is commissioning a service provider to develop software that is to be released on open source terms (either by the agency or by the service provider under a contractual obligation for the service provider to do so); and </li>
    <li>
    it is known that the developer will be leveraging or adapting existing open source software developed by others, </li>
</ol>
<p>the agency should act fairly towards the service provider in relation to the drafting of intellectual property warranties and indemnities.</p>
<p><strong>38.</strong> In particular, it is generally considered unreasonable to expect a service provider to give an unqualified intellectual property (<strong>IP</strong>) warranty and an unqualified IP indemnity in relation to third party open source
    software that the agency agrees can be used by the service provider in developing software for the agency. This is especially so when the agency will be releasing the developed software under an open source software licence or requires the service
    provider to do so on its behalf. Sample IP indemnity and IP warranty clauses are provided in the Annexure to NZGOAL-SE.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="liability">Liability</h2>
<p><strong>39.</strong> The MIT licence and the GPL both contain broad disclaimers of warranties and exclusions of liability that are widely known and acknowledged and ought to protect releasing agencies from liability in connection with the software they
    have released. In essence, people use free and open source software at their own risk. Agencies should ensure that all disclaimers and exclusions contained in the MIT licence or the GPL (as applicable) are replicated when they release software under
    these licences.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>
<h2 id="review-and-release-process">Review and Release Process</h2>
<p><strong>40.</strong> Government agencies should follow the NZGOAL-SE Review and Release Process before publicly releasing and licensing their software for re-use under a free and open source software licence. The Review and Release Process is set out
    below.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top"><strong>&uarr;Top</strong></a></p>

        <li id="fn7"> The MIT licence is considered preferable to the BSD 3-Clause licence (another commonly-used permissive open source software licence) because the MIT licence includes a clearer grant of rights and expressly includes the right to sub-license (the
            BSD licence does not). Whilst many interpret a right to sub-license as being implicit in the BSD licence, the absence of an express reference to it in the BSD licence could produce uncertainty for users, most notably users who wish to incorporate
            government-produced code in a work licensed under the GPL. The Free Software Foundation considers the BSD licence to be compatible with the GPL but that must depend on a particular interpretation of the BSD licence wording (see generally A
            Sinclair "License Profile: BSD" IFOSS Law Review, 2(1) pp. 1-6). The MIT licence doesn't contain the BSD's 'no endorsement' clause but, in most cases, the law would prevent claims of endorsement without permission anyway. Another common permissive
            licence, the Apache License 2.0, was not chosen because it is more complex. The Free Software Foundation considers it preferable to the BSD and MIT licences as it deals with patent licensing and prevents 'patent treachery'. However, in New
            Zealand the Patents Act 2013 excludes computer programs "as such" from patentable subject matter (and, in any event, historically government agencies have not generally been in the business of applying for software patents). NZGOAL-SE could
            have recommended its own bespoke permissive licence instead of the MIT licence but that would have contributed to further licence proliferation and exposed developers to a licence they're not familiar with. <a href="#fnref7">(back)</a> </li>

        <li id="fn10"> Whilst versions 2 and 3 of the GPL differ in certain respects, in essence the GPL allows people to copy and distribute the software, to charge a fee for transferring it or providing warranty protection, and to modify the software and distribute
            resulting derivative works. And, if a person distributes a derivative work, that person needs to license it under the GPL, otherwise that person's licence to use the software will terminate. The full text of versions 2 and 3 of the GPL (both
            versions are in common use) can be found on the website of the <em>Free Software Foundation</em> at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html"><em>http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html</em></a>. <a href="#fnref10">(back)</a>            </li>

        <li id="fn12"> Coordinated disclosures ensure there is clear and explicit process for both external contributors and agencies for the reporting of security bugs and issues in publicly released software. Guidance for the New Zealand context can be found on the

        <li id="fn13"> A diverging code fork occurs when agencies make changes to the code of open source software without publishing the code back to the software's development community. The fork is the split between the agency's version of the software and the version
            published by the community. Any further changes made by either the agency or the community will increase the differences of the source code. This can make it difficult for the agency to upgrade to a new published version, as the agency would
            have to reapply all its changes. This risk may be mitigated by contributing modified source code back to the open source software community if appropriate. <a href="#fnref13">(back)</a> </li>
        <li id="fn14"> A Contributor Licence Agreement, or CLA, is an agreement that sets out the terms under which a person or entity makes contributions to the project or software. A CLA will deal with licensing terms and can also agree with topics such as warranties
            and indemnities. <a href="#fnref14">(back)</a> </li>
        <li id="fn15"> The 'contributing' file could also seek to obtain a warranty (promise) from contributors that they have all the rights they require to submit their contributions on the terms of the specified licence and an indemnity in favour of the agency should
            it turn out that the contributor does not have the required rights. The indemnity clause would seek to enable the agency to recover, from a contributor, loss the agency incurs as a result of the contributor's breach of the warranty. NZGOAL-SE
            suggests, however, that including an indemnity could be unnecessary and/or counter-productive. Not only could it inhibit contributions but it could pose difficulties for contributing government departments given restrictions on the granting
            of indemnities under the Public Finance Act 1989. <a href="#fnref15">(back)</a> </li>
