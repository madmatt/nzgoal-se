# NZGOAL Software Extension (working repository for revision May 2016)

## Published
The NZGOAL Software Extension policy for the licensing of free and open source software was [published on ict.govt.nz](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/) on the 20th July 2016. This policy gives guidance to agencies on the licensing of software when they choose to release source code under open source terms for others to legally reuse.

## Public consultation (April-May 2016)
Thanks to everyone that input into the public process of developing NZGOAL Software Extension for free and open source software (FOSS) licensing in the New Zealand government. 

We worked through:

 - 16 threads of dialogue
 - 175 comments, and
 - over 28,000 words of discussion about this policy!

The engagement was outstanding and this is an excellent example of shared and collaborative decision making and open government approach.

## Revision process archive

 - The initial public consultation period ended, 30 April 2016 and was [carried out on Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/g/NohQxyr9/nzgoal-software-extension-discussion-of-draft) (online dialogue and collaborative decision making tool).

  - 2 - 15 May, 2016 we reviewed the conversations from the Loomio public consultation (carried out 30 March - 30 April, 2016) and worked out how to best incorporate these into the revision from a practical and legal point of view. We carried the revision out in a transparent manner on the Open Data NZ GitHub account. We raised proposals of change (pull requests) and commits to revise the policy based on public input. Where possible we've provided links back to the original online public conversations that guided the revisions and give inline supporting comments behind decisions.

 - For one week starting the 16 May 2016, we considered any final public contributions to the revision.

 - On 23 May we put the revised draft document for a legal review, only minor changes and we have additionally included sample templates for the IP warranty and indemnity in an appendix.

 - 30 May 2016, the final revised draft is posted on ict.govt.nz.
 
 - June - July 2016, consulation with other agencies.
 
 - 20 July 2016, NZGOAL Software Extension approved by Minister and [published on ict.govt.nz](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/).
