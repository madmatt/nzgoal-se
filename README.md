# Introduction for transparent revision process of NZGOAL-SE

## Public consultation
Thanks to everyone who has had input into the process of developing NZGOAL-SE for free and open source software licensing in the New Zealand government. We've worked through:

 - 16 threads of dialogue
 - 175 comments, and
 - over 28,000 words of discussion about this policy!

The engagement has been outstanding and an excellent example of shared and collaborative decision making.

[Discussions on Loomio.](https://www.loomio.org/g/NohQxyr9/nzgoal-software-extension-discussion-of-draft)

[Revision on GitHub.](https://github.com/opendatanz/nzgoal-se)

## What next?
The draft policy has now undergone a legal review and some minor amendments. The May 2016 revised version of NZGOAL-SE is available to view [view here](https://www.ict.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/Documents/NZGOAL-Software-Extension-Revision-May-2016.pdf).

Next step is for the policy to be submitted for review by relevant government agencies before finally going to the Minister and before a Cabinet Committee meeting.

Email [opendata@linz.govt.nz](mailto:opendata@linz.govt.nz) if you have any questions.


## Revision process archive

 - The initial public consultation period ended,30 April

 - We've carried this out in a transparent manner on the Open Data NZ GitHub account. We raised proposals of change (pull requests) and commits to revise the policy based on public input. Where possible we're provide links back to the original online public conversations that guided the revisions and give inline supporting comments behind decisions.

 - 2 - 15 May, 2016 we reviewed the conversations from the Loomio public consultation (carried out 30 March - 30 April, 2016) and worked out how to best incorporate these into the revision from a practical and legal point of view.

 - For one week starting the 16 May 2016, we considered any final public contributions to the revision.

 - On 23 May we put the revised draft document for a legal review, only minor changes and we have additionally included sample templates for the IP warranty and indemnity in an appendix.

 - 30 May, the final revised draft is posted on ict.govt.nz.
