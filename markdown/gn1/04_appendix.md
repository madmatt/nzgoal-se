Agencies are encouraged to include the following paragraphs in their
Requests For Proposals (RFPs) once they have decided to release procured
software code under an open source software licence. Communicating this
is consistent with [Rule 61 (Intellectual Property) of the Government
Rules of
Sourcing](http://www.procurement.govt.nz/procurement/for-agencies/key-guidance-for-agencies/the-new-government-rules-of-sourcing/6-other-rules-you-need-to-know#rule61)
and the [Statement of Policy set out in the Guidelines for Treatment of
Intellectual Property Rights in ICT
Contracts](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/procurement-advice/guidelines-for-the-treatment-of-intellectual-property-rights-in-ict-contracts/aim-statement/).
The paragraphs are written on the assumption that a draft contract is
attached to the RFP and that the draft contract confers ownership of new
intellectual property rights on the procuring agency. The specimen
clause for use in RFP below has been adapted from [NZGOAL Guidance Note 3: Procuring copyright works](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-guidance-notes/nzgoal-guidance-note-3/)[^19]
and reads as follows:

```
1.  Copyright and licensing

    a.  Respondents should note that [name of procuring agency] will
        own copyright in new copyright works created as a result of
        this procurement and may elect to release and license them for
        re-use in accordance with the New Zealand Government Open
        Access and Licensing framework Software Extension (NZGOAL-SE)
        under:

          i. for software, a free and open source software licence; and

          ii.for documentation, a Creative Commons licence.

        Except as indicated below, respondents should not seek to
        alter the intellectual property provisions in the draft
        contract attached to this RFP that confer ownership of new
        intellectual property on [name of procuring agency].

    b.  Respondents may, however, have a legitimate interest in being
        able to re-use such copyright works before [name of procuring
        agency] licenses them for re-use in accordance
        with NZGOAL-SE. Where that is the case, respondents should
        request an appropriate licence from the procuring agency
        allowing them to do so.

    c.  If a respondent feels there is overwhelming commercial or other
        reason as to why it must own the copyright in new copyright
        works under the contract, it should raise this with [name of
        procuring agency]. The respondent should expect that, if
        [name of procuring agency] allows the respondent to own
        copyright in new copyright works, [name of procuring agency]
        will require a licence to [name of procuring agency] that
        allows [name of procuring agency] to use the works for any
        purpose and to sub-license them for re-use under one or more
        of the licences referred to in NZGOAL-SE.
