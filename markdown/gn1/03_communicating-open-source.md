## Communicating open source release during procurement
40. The IPR Guidelines encourage communication of the copyright ownership
intention as part of a Notice of Procurement, such as Request for
Proposals (RFP), and rule 61 of the Government Rules of Sourcing
contains a similar statement that applies to new intellectual property
more generally. You should provide your reasoning for the decision to
help suppliers understand and encourage responses.

41. Considering your decision to open source license may occur as early as
an initial investment proposal or building a business case. Your
considerations may be informed through discussions with internal
stakeholders, other agencies and with suppliers through pre-market
engagement processes.

42. Once you have decided that your agency intends to release new software
code under an open source software licence, you will need to ensure you
communicate this as early as possible to suppliers.

43. There are three ideal times when you should communicate your agency's
intention to release publicly funded software under an open source
software licence: pre-market engagement, in your RFP and in the contract
(that will usually be attached to or mentioned in the RFP). Each are
covered in more detail below.

### Pre-market engagement
44. You may be putting together a business case or
request for information (RFI) to help define the problem you are trying
to solve with your software development project. Framing your project as
a user problem to be solved, rather than specifying a technical solution
at this early stage is useful. It's at this stage that your decision to
release the project as open source may also be informed as you learn
more about the project characteristics. You might also investigate the
"Prepare" and "Discovery" phases in the [ICT.govt.nz Accelerate project
framework](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/accelerate/)
to help guide your pre-market engagement.

45. For example, you may discover existing government open source solutions
that fit your needs (or at least in part). In this case your project may
reuse and build upon existing code, configuring it to your specific need
and contributing back any resulting new software code. Alternatively,
you may find out that the problem you are solving is being faced by
other agencies and nothing currently exists to solve it. Here the
reusability of the open source software code would be valuable to
release and communicating early to other agencies would avoid
duplication, give rise to a potential co-funding model[^17] and build
support for releasing the code under an open source licence to ensure
reuse by other agencies has a low transaction cost.

46. During a pre-market engagement consider:

 a. Communicating with a wider set of government agencies.
 b. Opening a dialogue with related communities of practice (online and
    in-person both locally and globally) in case they have solved the
    problem or would provide value helping to maintain software code you
    release as open source.
 c. Raising the idea of open source release with suppliers to gauge
    openness to developing software in the open.
 d. Building proofs of concept if no software exists to solve your
    problem (these could be released as open source to test demand and
    reusability of the project in a more tangible way).

### Request for proposal (RFP)
47. The IPR Guidelines state that agencies should set out the conditions of
copyright ownership in the RFP when going to market (which, at least for
purchases worth \$100,000 or more, will be via the Government Electronic
Tenders Service). If you have made the choice to release procured
software code under an open source licence, the RFP may be the earliest
point at which you communicate this to suppliers. Your RFP should ensure
it is clear that you are looking to procure developed software which you
would like to release under an open source licence and that you are
respecting the policy set out in the IPR Guidelines.

48. In your RFP we recommend that you:

 a. State your decision to open source license the developed software.
 b. Make use of the RFP paragraph insert in the
    [Appendix](appendix) of this guidance note.
 c. Where relevant, indicate the level of ongoing support and
    maintenance you might require from a supplier for your publicly
    released code
    i. If you have an internal team that will look after the project
        after release this may be "no maintenance required by supplier".
    ii. If youâ€™ve decided to release the code "AS IS" and keep open
        source community engagement to a minimum, this might be "no
        maintenance required by supplier".
    iii. If the project is likely to be under further active development
        by the supplier you may opt to have the supplier provide some or
        all maintenance and community management as a service.
    iv. Acknowledge that this might change over the lifecycle of the
        released code as external contributors may grow over time to
        provide shared maintenance or your internal teams develop skills
        in the software to be able to support it.

49. As a separate matter, it is also desirable to document your decision
process to open source license the software including your motivations,
concerns and risk mitigations.

50. You may also wish to determine the
approach to releasing the software code publicly[^18] including asking
questions such as:

 a. Will it be released once the work is completed as a whole?
 b. Will you require the supplier to release an early iteration?
 c. Will you require the supplier to carry out open development of the
    software?

### Contracts
51. Before reaching the contracting stage of the procurement, you should
have already explained your intention to release procured code under an
open source software licence. However, in some situations you may have
learnt through the RFP process that open source software release is
preferable. If the decision to open source license is made at this later
point and the supplier is also in agreement you should ensure that the
intellectual property provisions in your contract are drafted in a
manner that gives you the rights you need to release the software on
open source terms.

52. There are specimen contract clauses in the IPR Guidelines that can be
used as starting points for the intellectual property ownership and
licensing section of your software development contract. The clauses are
in Appendix One to the Guidelines and the relevant ones (short form,
medium form and long form) are numbered A3, B3 and C3 (the choice
between depends on the nature, value and risk of your procurement).

53. Note that you can also:

 a. replace the "Supplier Indemnity" clause in the IPR Guidelines Appendix One with the specimen "IP warranty and IP indemnity" clauses in the [Annexure of NZGOAL Software    Extension](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-se/annexure-specimen-ip-warranty-and-ip-indemnity-clauses/) in order to act in accordance with the "Act fairly towards developers when drafting IP warranties and indemnities" principle in NZGOAL-SE; and
 b. update your contract definitions with those from the NZGOAL Software Extension Annexure and the IPR Guidelines Appendix One, to the extent required.

54. Agencies are encouraged to seek assistance from their legal teams for these tasks.

[^17]: NZ Government Common Web Platform shared service has a co-fund
    open source model. See https://www.cwp.govt.nz/working-with-cwp/development-pool/

[^18]: Consider here that the longer a software project stays closed the
    more difficult it is to make open later. Developing in the open
    ensures code is produced in a way that is more maintainable as an
    open source project going forward. See
