## Purpose
1 This guidance note is to help government agencies understand:

 a. Considerations that are relevant to deciding whether to release new
    software code produced by a supplier (procured) under an open source
    software licence.

 b. When and how to communicate to suppliers during the procurement
    process should agencies decide to release code under an open source
    software licence.

 c. How to make use of the two current policies relating to software
    code procurement and open source as an end to end process.

2 It does not:

 a. Cover the use of existing open source software in procured projects
    from suppliers.

 b. Cover intellectual property rights other than copyright.

 c. Cover the treatment of copyright in newly developed works that are
    not software code (other than documentation that accompanies
    the code). These are dealt with in [NZGOAL Guidance Note
    3](https://www.ict.govt.nz/guidance-and-resources/open-government/new-zealand-government-open-access-and-licensing-nzgoal-framework/nzgoal-guidance-notes/nzgoal-guidance-note-3/).

-   Constitute legal advice. Agencies should seek legal advice from
    their legal advisors to the extent required.

## When to use this guidance?
3 You should use this guidance when:

 a.  You are procuring newly developed software code not already owned by
    your supplier; and

 b.  Your agency needs guidance on whether to release the developed
    software code as open source software using the NZGOAL-SE principles
    and release process.
