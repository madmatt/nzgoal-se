## Purpose

**1.** Government agencies invest significantly in software development
and often own the copyright in the software that they develop or that is
developed for them. Public sharing and the licensing of this
government-owned software under free and open source software licence
terms has the potential to:

a.  save agencies time and money, resulting in a more efficient use of
    scarce resources;
b.  encourage open innovation on the part of both the public and private
    sectors;
c.  contribute to economic growth, primarily through the private sector
    being able to leverage and support government investment in the
    software it openly releases for re-use;
d.  contribute to the formation of trusted communities of users whose
    public and private sector members have common or similar goals or
    interests;
e.  result in continuous and ongoing maintenance of the released
    software code through these communities of users in a way that may
    not be achievable by a single agency alone;
f.  enable agencies to better align their operational and strategic
    activities with relevant aspects of the Government ICT Strategy
    2015; and
g.  in some cases, foster transparency — for those who can read software
    code — as to the methods or algorithms used for the creation or
    delivery of public data and services, thereby enabling critical
    analysis and potentially the provision of improvements back to the
    releasing agency.

**2.** This NZGOAL Software Extension (**NZGOAL-SE**) provides agencies
with a means of realising this potential. It:

a.  explains the legal and policy context that is relevant to agencies'
    open source licensing of software;
b.  sets out a series of policy principles to guide agencies in their
    open sharing of software code;
c.  advocates the use of particular open source software licences for
    this purpose; and
d.  sets out a review and release process to guide agencies through the
    review of the software they propose to release for re-use, the
    purpose of which is to help agencies make decisions that are legally
    robust and practically useful.

## Free and open source software and licences

**3.** For the purposes of NZGOAL-SE, free and open source software
(**FOSS**) is software source code that is released on licence terms
that grant others the freedom to use, copy, modify and distribute the
software, for either non-commercial or commercial purposes, as long as
they comply with the applicable licensing conditions. It is important to
note the following:

a.  the licensing conditions that users of the software need to comply
    with depend on the form of FOSS licence applied to the software;
b.  "free" in FOSS refers to the granting of a set of "freedoms" or
    permissions usually only available to the copyright owner and
    arising from the bundle of property rights the owner has in its
    copyright work; and
c.  there are several common phrases in use that refer to the same style
    of licensing, such as "free software", "free and open source
    software", "open source", "FOSS", "OSS" and "FLOSS". Depending on
    the context, NZGOAL-SE uses a combination of "free and open source
    software", "FOSS" and "open source", all with the same meaning
    referred to above.

**4.** There are two main forms of FOSS licence:

a.  **more permissive licences** that confer broad freedoms and minimal
    obligations on those who wish to use, adapt and distribute the
    software (e.g., the MIT licence, the BSD licence and the Apache 2.0
    licence); and
b.  **sharealike licences** (also known as copyleft licences) that
    confer similar freedoms and require those who adapt the licensed
    software to license their adaptations with the same licence if they
    distribute them (e.g., the GNU General Public License, or GPL
    for short).

## Approach and scope

**5.** NZGOAL-SE is an extension of, and is modelled in part on the
approach to, the open licensing of government copyright works set out in
the New Zealand Government Open Access and Licensing framework
(**NZGOAL**). NZGOAL-SE is a self-contained extension or framework,
rather than being part of the original NZGOAL framework, because certain
considerations are different to those relating to open information and
data. Incorporating both frameworks under a single roof would unduly
complicate matters for agencies and others interested in the frameworks.

**6.** NZGOAL-SE is not concerned with the proprietary versus open
source debate or with the considerations that agencies may wish to take
into account when using existing open source for their own internal
purposes[^1]. Its sole focus is on the
public release and open source licensing by agencies of software they
own or are authorised to release and license.

### Additional guidance notes

**7.** Additional guidance notes may be released over time which:

a.  explore, in greater detail, some of the issues addressed or raised
    in NZGOAL-SE; or
b.  address operational or technical issues which arise in practice.
